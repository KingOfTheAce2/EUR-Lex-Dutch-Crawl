(2) Op 6 december 2017 heeft de Raad van Bestuur het T2-T2S-consolidatieproject goedgekeurd, dat tot doel heeft TARGET2 en TARGET2-Securities (T2S) te consolideren en te optimaliseren, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van state-of-theart-benaderingen en technologische innovatie en waardoor de gecombineerde operationele kosten kunnen dalen en het liquiditeitsbeheer in de verschillende diensten wordt verbeterd. Het resultaat van het T2-T2S-consolidatieproject is het nieuwe generatie trans-Europees geautomatiseerd realtime-brutovereveningssysteem waarin in euro in centrale-bankgeld wordt afgewikkeld (TARGET). (3) Met ingang van 21 november 2022 zal TARGET2 worden vervangen door TARGET. (4) Zoals bij TARGET2 dient TARGET juridisch te worden gestructureerd als een veelvoud van betalingssystemen, waarbij alle TARGET-deelsystemen zo veel mogelijk geharmoniseerd zijn. (5) TARGET verleent centrale liquiditeitsbeheersdiensten waaronder de afwikkeling van centralebankoperaties via de hoofdkasrekeningen ( main cash accounts — MCA’s), realtime-brutoverevening (real-time gross settlement — RTGS) van grote bedragen voor betalingen via RTGS-specifieke kasrekeningen ( dedicated cash accounts — RTGS DCA’s), contante betalingen in verband met de effectenafwikkeling via TARGET2-Securities-specifieke kasrekeningen ( T2S dedicated cash accounts — T2S DCA’s), afwikkeling van directe betalingen via TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS)-specifieke kasrekeningen ( TIPS dedicated cash accounts — TIPS DCA’s) en diensten voor afwikkeling van aangesloten systemen (AS) via subrekeningen, RTGS AS-technische rekeningen, AS-garantiefondsrekeningen en TIPS AS-technische rekeningen. (6) TARGET2-deelsystemen die eigendom zijn van en beheerd worden door de respectieve CB’s van het Eurosysteem zijn collectief geïdentificeerd ( 2 ) als systeemrelevante betalingssystemen (SIPS) ingevolge Verordening (EU) nr. 795/2014 van de Europese Centrale Bank (ECB/2014/28) ( 3 ) . De respectieve TARGET-deelsystemen, evenals de betalingssystemen die deze TARGET2-deelsystemen vervangen, vallen binnen het toepassingsgebied van Verordening (EU) nr. 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28) en dienen te voldoen aan de in die verordening neergelegde oversightvereisten. (7) TARGET-deelsystemen vormen de rechtsopvolgers van de corresponderende TARGET2-deelsystemen. (8) Op 24 februari 2022 heeft de Raad van Bestuur Richtsnoer (EU) 2022/912 van de Europese Centrale Bank (ECB/2022/8) ( 4 ) vastgesteld, waarbij Richtsnoer 2013/47/EU (ECB/2012/27) wordt ingetrokken. (9) De intrekking van Richtsnoer 2013/47/EU (ECB/2012/27) vereist wijzigingen van de voorwaarden van TARGET2-ECB. Omwille van de rechtszekerheid is het aangewezen om een nieuw besluit vast te stellen waarbij die wijzigingen worden omgezet. Derhalve moet Besluit 2007/601/EG van de Europese Centrale Bank (ECB/2007/7) ( 5 ) worden ingetrokken. (10) Teneinde een doeltreffende tenuitvoerlegging van Richtsnoer (EU) 2022/912 (ECB/2022/8) te waarborgen, moet dit besluit onverwijld in werking treden, HEEFT HET VOLGENDE BESLUIT VASTGESTELD: Artikel 1 Reikwijdte 1.   Het TARGET-deelsysteem van de ECB (TARGET-ECB) is beperkt tot de volgende operaties: a) het verwerken van de eigen betalingen van de ECB; b) het verwerken van de betalingen van klanten van de ECB; c) het verlenen van afwikkelingsdiensten aan entiteiten die aangesloten systemen beheren, met inbegrip van buiten de Europese Economische Ruimte gevestigde entiteiten, mits die entiteiten: i) onderworpen zijn aan oversight van een bevoegde autoriteit; ii) voldoen aan de oversightvereisten betreffende de locatie voor infrastructuren die diensten in euro aanbieden, zoals bekendgemaakt op de ECB-website; iii) toegang tot TARGET-ECB zijn verschaft door de Raad van Bestuur; 2.   De ECB kan enkel de volgende klanten accepteren en namens hen optreden: a) centrale banken; b) Europese organisaties; c) internationale organisaties; d) centrale overheden van lidstaten of openbare lichamen die door dergelijke centrale overheden zijn aangewezen krachtens een ad-hocbesluit van de Raad van Bestuur. Artikel 2 Definities Voor de toepassing van dit besluit gelden de in bijlage III opgenomen definities: Artikel 3 Voorwaarden voor deelname aan TARGET-ECB 1.   Deelname aan TARGET-ECB wordt uitsluitend beheerst door de in bijlage I opgenomen voorwaarden voor deelname aan TARGET-ECB. 2.   Overeenkomstig artikel 9, lid 2, van Richtsnoer (EU) 2022/912 (ECB/2022/8) opent de ECB met ingang van 20 november 2023 geen andere TARGET-rekeningen dan voor in aanmerking komende deelnemers voor het verlenen van diensten die binnen het toepassingsgebied van Richtsnoer (EU) 2022/912 (ECB/2022/8) vallen, met uitzondering van rekeningen die gebruikt worden voor het aanhouden van in beslag genomen middelen of aan derde-schuldeisers in pand gegeven middelen of middelen als bedoeld in artikel 3, lid 1, punt d), van Verordening (EU) nr. 2021/378 van de Europese Centrale Bank ( 6 ) . 3.   Deelname aan TARGET-ECB wordt in voorkomend geval eveneens beheerst door artikel 11 van Richtsnoer (EU) 2022/912 (ECB/2022/8). Artikel 4 Intrekking van Besluit 2007/601/EG (ECB/2007/7) Besluit 2007/601/EG (ECB/2007/7) wordt ingetrokken met ingang van 21 november 2022. Artikel 5 Inwerkingtreding Dit besluit treedt in werking op de vijfde dag volgende op die van de bekendmaking ervan in het Publicatieblad van de Europese Unie.

Article 4 Access criteria Entities managing ancillary systems (including entities established outside the European Economic Area (EEA)) and acting in that capacity, whose access to TARGET-ECB has been approved by the Governing Council, shall be the only entities that are eligible for participation in TARGET-ECB. Article 5 Application procedure 1.   In order to become a participant in TARGET-ECB, an eligible entity as described in Article 4 shall fulfil the following requirements: (a) install, manage, operate, monitor and ensure the security of the necessary IT infrastructure to connect to TARGET-ECB and be able to submit cash transfer orders to it. In doing so, applicant participants may involve third parties but retain sole liability; (b) have passed the tests required by the ECB; (c) if it is an applicant for an a RTGS DCA, a T2S DCA or a TIPS DCA it shall also hold or open an MCA with the ECB; (d) provide a capacity opinion in the form specified in Appendix III, unless the information and representations to be provided in such capacity opinion have already been obtained by the ECB in another context; (e) for the entities referred to in Article 4, established outside the EEA, provide a country opinion in the form specified in Appendix III, unless the information and representations to be provided in such country opinion have already been obtained by the ECB in another context; (f) if it is an applicant for a TIPS DCA, has adhered to the SCT Inst scheme by signing the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer Adherence Agreement; (g) if it is an applicant for a TIPS AS technical account, has provided evidence that the disclosure letter showing their intent to be an SCT Inst compliant Clearing and Settlement Mechanism (CSM) has been provided to the European Payments Council (EPC). 2.   Applicants shall apply to the ECB, as a minimum enclosing the following documents/information: (a) completed reference data collection forms as provided by the ECB; (b) the capacity opinion, if required by the ECB, and the country opinion, if required by the ECB; (c) if it is an applicant for a TIPS DCA, evidence of their adherence to the SCT Inst scheme; (d) if the applicant is applying to use the TIPS AS settlement procedure, evidence that they have provided the EPC with the disclosure letter showing their intent to be an SCT Inst compliant CSM; (e) if the applicant designates a paying agent, the evidence that the paying agent has agreed to act in that role. 3.   Applicants which are already TARGET participants and apply for a new account as described in: (i) Part III (RTGS-DCA); (ii) Part IV (T2S DCA); (iii) Part V (TIPS DCA); (iv) Part VI (RTGS AS technical account); and/or (v) Part VII (TIPS AS technical account), shall comply with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 to the extent relevant for the new account applied for. 4.   The ECB may also request any additional information it deems necessary to decide on an application to open a TARGET account. 5.   The ECB shall reject the application to participate if: (a) the applicant is not an eligible entity as described in Article 4; (b) one or more of the participation requirements referred to in paragraph 1 are not met; and/or (c) according to the ECB’s assessment, such participation would endanger the overall stability, soundness and safety of TARGET-ECB or of any other TARGET component system, or would jeopardise the ECB’s performance of its tasks as described in the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, or poses risks on the grounds of prudence. 6.   The ECB shall communicate its decision on the application to become a participant in TARGET-ECBto the applicant participant within one month of the ECB’s receipt of the application. Where the ECB requests additional information pursuant to paragraph 4, the decision shall be communicated within one month of the ECB’s receipt of this information from the applicant. Any rejection decision shall contain reasons for the rejection. Article 6 Participants AS which use the RTGS AS settlement procedures or the TIPS AS settlement procedure shall be subject to the terms and conditions set out in this Part as well as in Part VI or Part VII, respectively. They may hold one or more MCAs, T2S DCAs and, exceptionally and if approved by the ECB, one or more RTGS DCAs except in relation to the clearing of instant payments pursuant to the SCT Inst scheme. If an AS holds an RTGS DCA or a T2S DCA it shall also hold at least one MCA with the ECB. In the event that an AS holds one or more MCAs or RTGS DCAs or T2S DCAs, the respective Parts of these Conditions shall also apply. Article 7 Access to a participant’s account by entities other than the participant 1.   To the extent technically possible, a participant may give access to its TARGET accounts to one or more entities it designates, for the purposes of submitting cash transfer orders and performing other actions. 2.   Cash transfer orders submitted or funds received by the entities designated by a participant as referred to in paragraph 1 shall be deemed to have been submitted or received by that participant itself. 3.   The participant shall be bound by such cash transfer orders and any other action taken by the entity or entities referred to in paragraph 1, regardless of the content of, or any non-compliance with, the contractual or other arrangements between that participant and such entity. Article 8 Billing 1.   The ECB shall identify billable items according to Appendix VI and shall allocate each of them to the participant from which that billable item originates. 2.   Any fee payable in relation to a cash transfer order submitted by or cash transfer received by an AS, irrespective of whether it uses the RTGS AS settlement procedures or an RTGS DCA, shall be exclusively charged to that AS. 3.   Billable items generated by actions taken by the designated entities referred in Article 7, as well as by central banks acting on behalf of a participant, shall be allocated to the participant. 4.   The ECB shall issue separate invoices to the participant for the relevant services described in: (i) Part III (RTGS-DCA); (ii) Part IV (T2S DCA); (iii) Part V (TIPS DCA); (iv) Part VI (RTGS AS settlement procedures); and (v) Part VII (TIPS AS settlement procedure). 5.   The ECB shall settle each invoice by means of a direct debit of an MCA held by the participant, unless the participant has designated another participant in TARGET (which may be in TARGET-ECB or another component system) as a paying agent and instructed the ECB to debit the MCA of that paying agent. Such an instruction shall not release the participant from its obligation to pay each invoice. 6.   Where a paying agent has been designated, the participant will provide the ECB with evidence that the paying agent has agreed to act in that role. 7.   For the purposes of this Article, each AS shall be treated separately, even if two or more of them are operated by the same legal entity, and irrespective of whether or not the AS has been designated under Directive 98/26/EC. In the case of an AS that has not been designated under Directive 98/26/EC, it shall be identified as an AS by reference to the following criteria: (a) it is a formal arrangement, based on a contractual or legislative instrument, e.g. an agreement among the participants and the system operator; (b) it has multiple membership; (c) it has common rules and standardised arrangements; and (d) is for the purpose of clearing, netting and/or settlement of payments and/or securities between the participants. Article 9 Billing Groups 1.   Upon the request of the participant the ECB shall create a billing group to allow its members to benefit from the degressive pricing applicable to RTGS DCAs. The billing group may only include RTGS DCA holders belonging to the same banking group, from one or more TARGET component systems. 2.   Upon the request of an RTGS DCA holder the ECB shall add that RTGS DCA holder to or delete it from a billing group which may be in TARGET-ECB or in any other TARGET component system. The RTGS DCA holder shall inform all other members of the billing group of such a request prior to making it. 3.   RTGS DCA holders included in a billing group shall be invoiced individually as set out in Article 8. Article 10 Obligations of the ECB and the participant 1.   The ECB shall offer the services described in Parts II, III, IV, V, VI and VII of these Conditions where a participant has opted for and been granted an account as referred to therein. Save where otherwise provided in these Conditions or required by law, the ECB shall use all reasonable means within its power to perform its obligations under these Conditions, without guaranteeing a result. 2.   The ECB is the provider of services pursuant to these Conditions. Acts and omissions of the Level 3 NCBs shall be considered as acts and omissions of the ECB, for which it shall assume liability in accordance with Article 21. Participation pursuant to these Conditions shall not create a contractual relationship between participants and the Level 3 NCBs when any of the latter acts in its capacity as a Level 3 NCB. Instructions, messages or information which a participant receives from, or sends to, TARGET in relation to the services provided under these Conditions shall be deemed to be received from, or sent to, ECB. 3.   The participant shall pay to the ECB fees in accordance with Article 8. 4.   The participant shall ensure that it is technically connected to TARGET-ECB in accordance with TARGET operating schedule set out in Appendix V. This obligation may be fulfilled through a designated entity referred to in Article 7. 5.   The participant shall represent and warrant to the ECB that the performance of its obligations under these Conditions does not breach any law, regulation or by-law applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound. 6.   The participant shall pay any applicable stamp duties or other documentary taxes or duties, if applicable, as well as any other costs the participant incurs in opening, maintaining or closing its TARGET account. Article 11 Cooperation and information exchange 1.   In performing their obligations and exercising their rights under these Conditions, the ECB and participants shall cooperate closely to ensure the stability, soundness and safety of TARGET-ECB. They shall provide each other with any information or documents relevant for the performance of their respective obligations and the exercise of their respective rights under these Conditions, without prejudice to any banking secrecy obligations. 2.   The ECB shall establish and maintain a system support desk to assist participants in relation to difficulties arising in connection with system operations. 3.   Up-to-date information on the operational status of each service shall be available on a TARGET Information System (TIS) on a dedicated webpage on the ECB’s website. 4.   The ECB may communicate system relevant messages to participants by means of a broadcast message or, if this means is not available, by any other appropriate means of communication. 5.   Participants shall update in a timely manner existing reference data collection forms and submit new reference data collection forms to the ECB. Participants shall verify the accuracy of information relating to them that is entered into TARGET-ECB by the ECB. 6.   The participant hereby authorises the ECB to communicate to the Level 3 NCBs any information relating to participants which the Level 3 NCBs may need, in accordance with the agreements between the Level 3 NCBs and the Eurosystem CBs governing the provision of the services to be provided by the Level 3 NCBs. 7.   Participants shall inform the ECB without undue delay about any change in their legal capacity and relevant legislative changes affecting issues covered by the country opinion as set out in the terms of reference given in Appendix III. 8.   The ECB may at any time request an update or renewal of the country or capacity opinions referred to in Article 5(1), points (d) and (e). 9.   Participants shall immediately inform the ECB if an event of default occurs in relation to themselves or if they are subject to crisis prevention measures or crisis management measures within the meaning of Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) or any other equivalent applicable legislation. Article 12 Remuneration of Accounts 1.   MCAs, DCAs and sub-accounts shall either be remunerated at zero per cent or at the deposit facility rate, whichever is lower. 2.   Overnight balances held on a TIPS AS technical account or on an RTGS AS technical account for AS settlement procedure D, and guarantee funds, including those held on an AS guarantee fund account, shall be remunerated at the deposit facility rate. Article 13 Management of Accounts 1.   Participants shall monitor and manage the liquidity on their accounts in line with the TARGET operating schedule as set out in Appendix V and perform transaction-level reconciliation at least once a day. This obligation may be fulfilled through a designated entity referred to in Article 7. 2.   The participant shall make use of the tools provided by the ECB for the purpose of account reconciliation, in particular the daily statement of account which is made available to each participant. This obligation may be fulfilled through a designated entity referred to in Article 7. 3.   Participants shall immediately inform the ECB in the event that a mismatch occurs in relation to any of their accounts. Article 14 Floor and ceiling amounts 1.   The participant may set floor and ceiling amounts on its MCA or DCAs. 2.   The participant may choose to receive a notification if the floor or ceiling amount is breached. In addition, for MCAs or RTGS DCAs the participant may opt for the breach to trigger a rule-based liquidity transfer order. 3.   The settlement of a liquidity transfer order shall not trigger a check of whether the floor or ceiling amount has been breached. Article 15 Account monitoring group 1.   An MCA holder may create one or more account monitoring groups for the purpose of monitoring liquidity on several MCAs or DCAs and will become the leader party for any account monitoring group that it creates. 2.   A participant may add any of its MCAs or DCAs opened within TARGET-ECB or any other TARGET component system to one or more account monitoring groups and thereby become a member of that account monitoring group. A member of an account monitoring group may initiate the removal of its account from that account monitoring group at any time. A participant shall inform the leader party of an account monitoring group prior to adding an account to or removing an account from that account monitoring group. 3.   Only the leader party for an account monitoring group shall be able to view the balances of all accounts included in that account monitoring group. 4.   The leader party may delete the account monitoring group and shall inform the other members of the account monitoring group prior to such deletion.

The ECB shall inform the participant of any rejection of a cash transfer order, as specified in Appendix I. Article 17 Entry of cash transfer orders into the system and their irrevocability 1.   For the purposes of the first sentence of Articles 3(1) and 5 of Directive 98/26/EC and the third sentence of § 116, § 96(2), § 82 and § 340(3) of the Insolvenzordnung (German Insolvency Code) and the sixth sentence of § 46a(1) of the KWG: (a) all cash transfer orders, except as provided for in points b), c) and d) of this paragraph, shall be deemed entered into TARGET-ECB and irrevocable at the moment that the relevant participant’s TARGET account is debited; (b) instant payment orders shall be deemed entered into TARGET-ECB and irrevocable at the moment that the relevant funds on the TIPS DCA of the participant or on its TIPS AS technical account are reserved; (c) in the case of transactions that are settled on T2S DCAs and that are subject to matching of two separate transfer orders: (i) such transfer orders, except as provided for in point (ii) of this subparagraph, shall be deemed entered into TARGET-ECB at the moment at which they have been declared compliant with the technical rules of T2S by the T2S Platform and irrevocable at the moment the transaction has been given the status ‘matched’ on the T2S Platform; (ii) in the case of transactions involving one participating CSD that has a separate matching component where transfer orders are sent directly to that participating CSD to be matched in its separate matching component, such transfer orders shall be deemed entered into TARGET-ECB at the moment at which they have been declared compliant with the technical rules of T2S by that participating CSD and irrevocable from the moment the transaction has been given the status ‘matched’ on the T2S Platform. A list of participating CSDs referred to in this point (ii) is available on the ECB’s website; (d) cash transfer orders in connection with RTGS AS settlement procedures shall be deemed entered in the TARGET component system of the account to be debited at the moment at which they are accepted by that TARGET component system and irrevocable at that moment. 2.   The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not affect any rules of AS that stipulate a moment of entry into the AS and/or irrevocability of transfer orders submitted to it at a point in time earlier than the moment of entry of the respective AS transfer orders in the relevant TARGET component system. 3.   Cash transfer orders included in an algorithm may not be revoked during the period that the algorithm is running. Article 18 Business continuity and contingency procedures 1.   In the event of an abnormal external event or any other event which affects transactions on the TARGET accounts, the business continuity and contingency procedures described in Appendix IV shall apply. 2.   In exceptional circumstances the TARGET operating schedule may be changed, in which case participants will be informed by the ECB. 3.   In exceptional circumstances an AS may make a request to the ECB to modify the TARGET operating schedule. 4.   The Eurosystem provides a Contingency Solution for use if the events described in paragraph 1 occur. Connection to and use of the Contingency Solution shall be mandatory for participants considered by the ECB] to be critical and for participants that settle very critical transactions as set out in Appendix IV. Other participants may, on request, connect to the Contingency Solution. Article 19 Security requirements 1.   Participants shall implement adequate security controls to protect their systems from unauthorised access and use. Participants shall be exclusively responsible for the adequate protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their systems. 2.   Participants shall immediately inform the ECB of any security-related incidents in their technical infrastructure and, where appropriate, security-related incidents that occur in the technical infrastructure of the third-party providers. The ECB may request further information about the incident and, if necessary, request that the participant take appropriate measures to prevent a recurrence of such an event. 3.   The ECB may impose additional security requirements, in particular with regard to cybersecurity or the prevention of fraud, on all participants and/or on participants that are considered critical by the ECB. 4.   Participants shall provide the ECB with: (i) permanent access to their attestation of adherence to their chosen NSP’s endpoint security requirements; and (ii) on an annual basis the TARGET self-certification statement as required for the types of accounts that they hold and as published on the ECB’s website. 5.   The ECB shall assess the participant’s self-certification statement(s) on the participant’s level of compliance with each of the requirements set out in the TARGET selfcertification requirements. These requirements are listed in Appendix VII. 6.   The participant’s level of compliance with the requirements of the TARGET self-certification shall be categorised as follows, in increasing order of severity: ‘full compliance’; ‘minor non-compliance’; or, ‘major non-compliance’. The following criteria apply: full compliance is reached where participants satisfy 100 % of the requirements; minor non-compliance is where a participant satisfies less than 100 % but at least 66 % of the requirements and major non-compliance where a participant satisfies less than 66 % of the requirements. If a participant demonstrates that a specific requirement is not applicable to it, it shall be considered as compliant with the respective requirement for the purposes of the categorisation. A participant which fails to reach ‘full compliance’ shall submit an action plan demonstrating how it intends to reach full compliance. The ECB shall inform the relevant supervisory authorities of the status of such participant’s compliance. 7.   If the participant refuses to grant permanent access to its attestation of adherence to its chosen NSPs endpoint security requirements or does not provide the TARGET self-certification, the participant’s level of compliance shall be categorised as ‘major non-compliance’. 8.   The ECB shall re-assess compliance of participants on an annual basis. 9.   The ECB may impose the following measures of redress on participants whose level of compliance was assessed as minor or major non-compliance, in increasing order of severity: (a) enhanced monitoring: the participant shall provide the ECB with a monthly report, signed by a senior executive, on its progress in addressing the non-compliance. The participant shall additionally incur a monthly penalty charge for each affected account of EUR 1 000. This measure of redress may be imposed in the event the participant receives a second consecutive assessment of minor non-compliance or an assessment of major noncompliance; (b) suspension: participation in TARGET-ECB may be suspended in the circumstances described in Article 24(2), points (b) and/or (c).

For the purposes of this paragraph, the taking of crisis prevention measures or crisis management measures within the meaning of Directive 2014/59/EU against a participant shall not automatically qualify as the opening of insolvency proceedings. 2.   The ECB may terminate without prior notice or suspend the participant’s participation in TARGET-ECB if: (a) one or more events of default (other than those referred to in paragraph 1) occur; (b) the participant is in material breach of any of these Conditions; (c) the participant fails to carry out any material obligation to the ECB; (d) the participant ceases to have a valid agreement with an NSP to provide the necessary connection to TARGET; (e) any other participant-related event occurs which, in the ECB’s assessment, would threaten the overall stability, soundness and safety of TARGET-ECB or of any other TARGET component system, or which would jeopardise the ECB’s performance of its tasks as described in the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, or poses risks on the grounds of prudence; (f) the ECB suspends or terminates the participant’s access to intraday credit, including auto-collateralisation, pursuant to Part II, Article 13 of Guideline (EU) 2022/912 (ECB/2022/8); and/or (g) the participant is excluded from or otherwise ceases to be a member of one of the NSP Closed Group of Users. 3.   In exercising its discretion under paragraph 2, the ECB shall take into account, inter alia, the seriousness of the event of default or events mentioned in points (a) to (c) of paragraph 2. 4.   In the event that the ECB suspends or terminates a participant’s participation in TARGET-ECB under paragraphs 1 or 2, the ECB shall without undue delay inform – by means of a broadcast message or, if that is not available, by any other appropriate means of communication – the respective participant, other CBs and participants in all of the TARGET component systems of such suspension or termination. Such message shall be deemed to have been issued by the home CB of the respective participant. 5.   Once a message issued under paragraph 4 has been received by the participants, they shall be deemed informed of the termination/suspension of a participant’s participation in TARGET-ECB or another TARGET component system. The participants shall bear any losses arising from the submission of a cash transfer order to participants whose participation has been suspended or terminated if such cash transfer order was entered into TARGET-ECB after receipt of the message.

The ECB is instructed to execute further reservation orders until the outstanding amount to be reserved is reached. Pending reservation orders shall be rejected at the end of the business day. 3.   Central bank operations shall be settled using the liquidity reserved as set out in paragraph 1 and other cash transfer orders shall only be settled using liquidity available after the amount reserved has been deducted. 4.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, in the event of insufficient unreserved liquidity on the MCA holder’s primary MCA for the purpose of decreasing the MCA holder’s line of intraday credit the ECBshall use the liquidity reserved. Article 9 Processing of cash transfer orders in the event of suspension or termination 1.   Upon termination of a participant’s participation in TARGET-ECB, the ECB shall not accept any new cash transfer orders from that participant. Cash transfer orders in the queue, warehoused cash transfer orders or new cash transfer orders in favour of that participant shall be rejected. 2.   If a participant is suspended from TARGET-ECB on grounds other than those specified in Part I, Article 24 (1), point (a), the ECB shall store all of that participant’s incoming and outgoing cash transfer orders on its MCA and only submit them for settlement after they have been explicitly accepted by the suspended participant’s CB. 3.   If a participant is suspended from TARGET-ECB on the grounds specified in Part I, Article 24(1), point (a), any outgoing cash transfer orders from that participant’s MCA shall only be processed on the instructions of its representatives, including those appointed by a competent authority or a court, such as the participant’s insolvency administrator, or pursuant to an enforceable decision of a competent authority or a court providing instructions as to how the cash transfer orders are to be processed.

By authorising its RTGS DCA to be debited, the RTGS DCA holder instructs the ECB to execute a rule-based liquidity transfer order that credits the MCA(s) whenever the floor is breached. 3.   An RTGS DCA holder may authorise its MCA designated for the purpose of automated liquidity transfer orders under Article 1(5) and (6) to be debited in the event that there is insufficient liquidity on the RTGS DCA to settle urgent payment orders, AS transfer orders or high priority payment orders on its RTGS DCA. Article 8 Priority rules 1.   The order of priority for the processing of cash transfer orders, in descending level of urgency, shall be: (a) urgent; (b) high; (c) normal. 2.   The following orders shall automatically be assigned the priority ‘urgent’: (a) AS transfer orders; (b) liquidity transfer orders including automated liquidity transfer orders; (c) cash transfer orders to an AS technical account for RTGS AS settlement procedure D. 3.   All cash transfer orders not listed in paragraph 2 shall automatically be assigned the priority ‘normal’, except payment orders to which the RTGS DCA holder has at its discretion assigned the priority ‘high’. Article 9 Processing of cash transfer orders on RTGS DCAs 1.   Cash transfer orders on RTGS DCAs shall be settled immediately they are accepted, or later as indicated by the RTGS DCA holder in accordance with Article 16 or Article 17, provided in all cases that: (a) there is available liquidity on the payer’s RTGS DCA; (b) no cash transfer orders of equal or higher priority are queued; and (c) any debit limits set in accordance with Article 15 are observed. 2.   If any of the conditions set out in points (a) to (c) of paragraph 1 are not met in relation to a cash transfer order, the following shall apply. (a) In the case of an automated liquidity transfer order, the ECB is instructed to execute the instruction partially and to execute further liquidity transfers whenever liquidity is available, up to the amount of the initial automated liquidity transfer order. (b) In the case of an immediate liquidity transfer order, the order shall be rejected without partial settlement or any further attempt to settle unless the order is initiated by an AS, in which case it shall be partially settled without any further attempt to settle. (c) In the case of a standing liquidity transfer order or a rule-based liquidity transfer order, the order shall be partially settled without any further attempt to settle. A standing liquidity transfer order triggered by mandatory RTGS AS settlement procedures C or D and for which there are insufficient funds on the RTGS DCA shall be settled following a pro rata reduction of all orders. A standing liquidity transfer order triggered by optional RTGS AS settlement procedure C and for which there are insufficient funds on the RTGS DCA shall be rejected. 3.   Cash transfer orders on RTGS DCAs, other than those orders referred to in paragraph 2 shall be queued and processed in accordance with the rules set out in Article 10. Article 10 Queue management and settlement optimisation 1.   Cash transfer orders on RTGS DCAs that are queued in accordance with Article 9(3) shall be processed according to their priority. Subject to paragraph 2 to 5, the ‘first in, first out' (FIFO) principle shall apply within each category or subcategory of cash transfer orders priority as follows: (a) urgent cash transfer orders: the automated liquidity transfer orders shall be placed first in the queue. AS transfer orders and other urgent cash transfer orders shall be placed next in the queue; (b) high priority cash transfer orders shall not be settled while urgent cash transfer orders are queued; (c) normal priority cash transfer orders shall not be settled while urgent or high priority cash transfer orders are queued. 2.   The payer may change the priority of its cash transfer orders other than urgent cash transfer orders. 3.   The payer may change the position of its cash transfer orders in the queue. The payer may move such cash transfer orders either behind the automated liquidity transfer orders in the queue or to the end of the respective queue with immediate effect at any time during the settlement window for customer and interbank payments as specified in Appendix V. 4.   To optimise the settlement of queued cash transfer orders, the ECB may: (a) use the optimisation procedures described in Appendix I; (b) settle cash transfer orders with a lower priority (or of the same priority but accepted later) before cash transfer orders with a higher priority (or of the same priority accepted earlier), if the cash transfer orders with a lower priority would net out with payments to be received and result on balance in a liquidity increase for the payer; (c) settle cash transfer orders with normal priority before other queued normal priority payments accepted earlier, provided that sufficient funds are available and notwithstanding that this may contravene the FIFO principle. 5.   Queued cash transfer orders shall be rejected if they cannot be settled by the cut-off times for the relevant message type as specified in Appendix V. 6.   The provisions regarding settlement of cash transfer orders as set out in Appendix I shall apply. Article 11 Liquidity reservation orders 1.   An RTGS DCA holder may instruct the ECB to reserve a specified amount of liquidity on its RTGS DCA using one of the following: (a) a current liquidity reservation order that shall have immediate effect for the current TARGET business day; (b) a standing liquidity reservation order to be carried out at the start of every TARGET business day. 2.   An RTGS DCA holder shall assign one of the following statuses to a current or standing liquidity reservation order: (a) high priority: allows the usage of the liquidity for urgent or high priority cash transfer orders; (b) urgent priority: allows the usage of the liquidity only for urgent cash transfer orders. 3.   In the event that the amount of unreserved liquidity is not sufficient to fulfil the current or standing liquidity reservation order, the ECB shall partially execute the reservation order and is instructed to execute further reservation orders until the outstanding amount to be reserved is reached. Pending reservation orders shall be rejected at the end of the business day. 4.   By requesting the reservation of a specified amount of liquidity for usage for urgent cash transfer orders, the RTGS DCA holder instructs the ECB only to settle high priority and normal priority cash transfer orders if there is available liquidity after the amount reserved for usage for urgent cash transfer orders has been deducted. 5.   By requesting the reservation of a specified amount of liquidity for usage for high priority cash transfer orders, the RTGS DCA holder instructs the ECB only to settle normal priority cash transfer orders if there is available liquidity after the amount reserved for usage for urgent and high priority cash transfer orders has been deducted. Article 12 Recall request and answer 1.   An RTGS DCA holder may enter a recall request to request the return of a settled payment order. 2.   The recall request shall be forwarded to the payee of the settled payment order which may answer positively or negatively. A positive answer does not initiate a return of the funds. Article 13 RTGS directory 1.   The RTGS directory is a list of BICs used for the purpose of routing information and comprises the BICs of: (a) RTGS DCA holders; (b) any entity with multi-addressee access; (c) addressable BIC holders. 2.   The RTGS directory shall be updated daily. 3.   Unless otherwise requested by an RTGS DCA holder, its BICs shall be published in the RTGS directory. 4.   RTGS DCA holders may only distribute the RTGS directory to their branches and entities with multiaddressee access. 5.   RTGS DCA holders acknowledge that the ECB and other CBs may publish RTGS DCA holders’ names and BICs. In addition, names and BICs of addressable BIC holders or entities with multi-addressee access may be published and RTGS DCA holders shall ensure that addressable BIC holders or entities with multi-addressee access have agreed to such publication. Article 14 Processing of cash transfer orders in the event of suspension or termination 1.   Upon termination of an RTGS DCA holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB, the ECB shall not accept any new cash transfer orders from that RTGS DCA holder. Cash transfer orders in the queue, warehoused cash transfer orders or new cash transfer orders in favour of that RTGS DCA holder shall be rejected. 2.   If an RTGS DCA holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB is suspended on grounds other than those specified in Part I, Article 25(1), point (a), the ECB shall store all of that RTGS DCA holder’s incoming and outgoing cash transfer orders on its RTGS DCA and only submit them for settlement after they have been explicitly accepted by the suspended RTGS DCA holder’s CB. 3.   If an RTGS DCA holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB is suspended on the grounds specified in Part I, Article 25(1), point (a), any outgoing cash transfer orders from that RTGS DCA holder’s RTGS DCA shall only be processed on the instructions of its representatives, including those appointed by a competent authority or a court, such as the RTGS DCA holder’s insolvency administrator, or pursuant to an enforceable decision of a competent authority or a court providing instructions as to how the cash transfer orders are to be processed. All incoming cash transfer orders shall be processed in accordance with paragraph 2. Article 15 Debit limits 1.   An RTGS DCA holder may limit the use of available liquidity for payment orders on its individual RTGS DCAs in relation to other RTGS DCAs, except any of the CBs, by specifying bilateral or multilateral limits. Such limits may only be defined in relation to normal priority payment orders. 2.   By specifying a bilateral limit, an RTGS DCA holder instructs the ECB that an accepted payment order shall not be settled if the sum of its outgoing normal priority payment orders to another RTGS DCA holder’s RTGS DCA minus the sum of all incoming urgent, high priority and normal priority payments from that RTGS DCA (the net bilateral position) would exceed this bilateral limit. 3.   An RTGS DCA holder may specify a multilateral limit for any relationship that is not subject to a bilateral limit. A multilateral limit may only be specified if the RTGS DCA holder has set at least one bilateral limit. If an RTGS DCA holder specifies a multilateral limit, it instructs the ECB that an accepted payment order shall not be settled if the sum of its outgoing normal priority payment orders to all RTGS DCA holders’ RTGS DCAs in relation to which no bilateral limit has been specified minus the sum of all incoming urgent, high priority and normal priority payments from those RTGS DCAs (the net multilateral position) would exceed this multilateral limit. 4.   Limits may be changed in real time with immediate effect or with effect from the next business day. If a limit is changed to zero, it shall not be possible to change it again on the same business day. The definition of a new bilateral or multilateral limit shall only be effective from the next business day. Article 16 Participants’ instructions with regard to settlement times 1.   An RTGS DCA holder may indicate the earliest time before which a payment order cannot settle or the latest time after which time the payment order will be rejected by using the earliest debit time indicator or the latest debit time indicator, respectively, or may indicate a time range during which the payment order will settle by using both indicators. An RTGS DCA holder may also use the latest debit time indicator solely as a warning indicator. In such cases, the payment order concerned shall not be rejected. 2.   In the event that 15 minutes prior to the indicated latest debit time the payment order has not been settled, the RTGS DCA holder concerned shall be notified accordingly. Article 17 Payment orders submitted in advance 1.   Payment orders may be submitted up to 10 calendar days before the specified settlement date (warehoused payment orders). 2.   Warehoused payment orders shall be accepted and submitted for processing on the date specified by the RTGS DCA holder at the start of settlement window on that day for customer and interbank payments, as referred to in Appendix V. They shall be placed in front of payment orders of the same priority. Article 18 Direct debit 1.   An RTGS DCA holder (payer) may give its authorisation for another RTGS DCA holder (payee) in TARGET-ECB or in another TARGET component system to debit the payer’s RTGS DCA by direct debit. 2.   To enable such arrangement the payer shall provide a prior authorisation to the ECB entitling the ECB to debit the payer’s RTGS DCA upon receipt of a valid direct debit instruction. 3.   If a payee receives the authorisation as described in paragraph 1, it may submit direct debit instructions to debit the payer’s RTGS DCA by the amount specified in the instruction. 4.   An RTGS DCA holder that requests to be added to a settlement bank account group of an AS shall be deemed to have given authorisation to the ECB entitling the ECB to debit the RTGS DCA holder’s RTGS DCA and sub-account upon receipt of a valid direct debit instruction by that AS. Article 19 Back-up payment functionality In the event of the failure of its payment infrastructure, an RTGS DCA holder may request the ECB to activate the back-up payment functionality. This allows the RTGS DCA holder to enter certain payment orders using the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Article 20 Security rights in relation to funds on sub-accounts 1.   The ECB shall have a pledge over the balance on an RTGS DCA holder’s sub-account opened under the arrangements between the relevant AS and its CB for the settlement of AS-related payment instructions in accordance with RTGS AS settlement procedure C. Such balance shall collateralise the RTGS DCA holder’s obligation referred to in paragraph 7 towards the ECB in relation to such settlement. 2.   Upon receipt by the ECB of a ‘start-of-cycle’ message, the ECB shall ensure that the balance on the sub-account of the RTGS DCA holder (including increases or reductions of that balance resulting from crediting or debiting cross-system settlement payments to or from the sub-account, or from crediting liquidity transfers to the sub-account) at the moment the AS starts a cycle can only be used for the settlement of AS transfer orders related to that settlement procedure C. Upon receipt by the ECB of an ‘end-of-cycle’ message the balance on the sub-account shall be available for the use of the RTGS DCA holder. 3.   By confirming the balance on the RTGS DCA holder’s sub-account, the ECB guarantees to the AS payment up to the amount of this particular balance. By confirming, where applicable, the increase or reduction of the balance upon crediting or debiting cross-system settlement payments to or from the sub-account or crediting liquidity transfers to the sub-account, the guarantee is automatically increased or reduced by the amount of the payment. Notwithstanding the abovementioned increase or reduction of the guarantee, the guarantee shall be irrevocable, unconditional and payable on first demand. If the ECB is not the AS’s CB, the ECB shall be deemed instructed to issue the abovementioned guarantee to the AS’s CB. 4.   In the absence of any insolvency proceedings in relation to the RTGS DCA holder, the AS transfer orders for the squaring of the RTGS DCA holder’s settlement obligation shall be settled without drawing on the guarantee and without recourse to the security right over the balance on the RTGS DCA holder’s sub-account. 5.   In the event of the RTGS DCA holder’s insolvency, the AS transfer orders for the squaring of the RTGS DCA holder’s settlement obligation shall be a first demand for payment under the guarantee; the debiting of the instructed amount from the RTGS DCA holder’s sub-account (and crediting of the AS’s RTGS AS technical account) shall therefore equally involve the discharge of the guarantee obligation by the ECB and a realisation of its collateral right over the balance on the RTGS DCA holder’s sub-account. 6.   The guarantee shall expire upon receipt by the ECB of an ‘end-of-cycle’ message confirming that the settlement has been completed. 7.   The RTGS DCA holder shall be obliged to reimburse to the ECB any payment made by the latter under such guarantee. PART IV Special terms and conditions for TARGET2-securities dedicated cash accounts (T2S DCAs) Article 1 Opening and management of a T2S DCA 1.   The ECB shall on the request of an MCA holder open and operate one or more T2S DCAs. 2.   There shall be no debit balance on a T2S DCA. 3.   A T2S DCA holder shall designate one MCA for the purpose of processing liquidity transfer orders between T2S DCAs as referred to in Article 3(1), point (c). The designated MCA may be held in TARGET-ECB or another TARGET component system and may belong to a different participant. Article 2 Links between securities accounts and T2S DCAs 1.   A T2S DCA holder may request the ECB to link its T2S DCA to one or more securities account(s) held on its own behalf or on behalf of its clients which hold securities accounts in one or more participating CSDs. 2.   T2S DCA holders linking their T2S DCA to securities account(s) on behalf of clients as set out in paragraph 1 are responsible for establishing and maintaining the list of linked securities accounts and, where relevant, the set-up of the client-collateralisation feature. 3.   As a result of the request under paragraph 1, the T2S DCA holder is deemed to have given a mandate to the CSD where such linked securities accounts are maintained to debit the T2S DCA with the amounts resulting from securities transactions taking place on these securities accounts. 4.   Paragraph 3 shall apply regardless of any agreements the T2S DCA holder has with the CSD and/or the securities account holders. Article 3 Transactions processed on T2S DCAs 1.   The following transactions shall be processed via a T2S DCA in TARGET-ECB: (a) the settlement of cash instructions stemming from T2S provided that the T2S DCA holder has designated the relevant securities account(s), as referred to in Article 2; (b) liquidity transfer orders to an RTGS DCA, a TIPS DCA or an MCA; (c) liquidity transfer orders between T2S DCAs belonging to the same participant or in respect of which the same MCA has been designated pursuant to Article 1(3); (d) cash transfer orders between the T2S DCA and the T2S DCA of the ECB in the particular context of Article 10(2) and (3). 2.   Corporate actions payments may be processed via a T2S DCA. Article 4 Liquidity transfer orders A T2S DCA holder may submit liquidity transfer orders as one of the following: (a) an immediate liquidity transfer order, which shall be an instruction for execution immediately; (b) a standing liquidity transfer order, which shall be an instruction for the recurring execution of (i) a transfer of a specified transfer amount or (ii) a transfer to reduce the balance of the T2S DCA to a predefined level with the amount of the reduction being transferred to an RTGS DCA, a TIPS DCA or an MCA, on the occurrence of a predefined event each business day. (c) a predefined liquidity transfer order, which shall be an instruction for the single execution of (i) a transfer of a specified transfer amount or (ii) a transfer to reduce the balance of the T2S DCA to a predefined level with the amount of the reduction being transferred to an RTGS DCA, a TIPS DCA or an MCA, on the occurrence of a predefined event each business day. Article 5 Reservation and blocking of liquidity 1.   Participants may reserve or block liquidity on their T2S DCAs. This does not constitute a settlement guarantee vis-à-vis any third party. 2.   By requesting to reserve or block an amount of liquidity, a participant instructs the ECB to decrease the available liquidity by this amount. 3.   A reservation request is an instruction by which, if the available liquidity is equal to or higher than the amount to be reserved, the reservation is processed. If the available liquidity is lower, it is reserved and the shortfall may be met by incoming liquidity until the full amount of the reservation is available. 4.   A blocking request is an instruction by which, if the available liquidity is equal to or higher than the amount to be blocked, the blocking request is processed. If the available liquidity is lower, no amount is blocked and the blocking request is resubmitted, until the full amount of the blocking request can be met by available liquidity. 5.   The participant may at any time during the business day on which a request to reserve or block liquidity has been processed, instruct the ECB to cancel the reservation or blocking. Partial cancellation shall not be permitted. 6.   All requests for reservation or blocking of liquidity under this article shall expire at the end of the business day. Article 6 Processing of liquidity transfer orders on T2S DCAs 1.   A timestamp for the processing of liquidity transfer orders is allocated in the sequence of their receipt. 2.   All liquidity transfer orders submitted to TARGET-ECB shall be processed following the ‘first in, first out’ (FIFO) principle without prioritisation or reordering. 3.   After a liquidity transfer order to a TIPS DCA, an MCA, an RTGS DCA or a T2S DCA has been accepted as set out in Part I, Article 16, the TARGET-ECB shall check if sufficient funds are available on the payer’s T2S DCA to effect settlement. If sufficient funds are available, the liquidity transfer order shall be settled immediately. If sufficient funds are not available, the following shall apply: (a) in the case of an immediate liquidity transfer order, the order shall be rejected without partial settlement or any further attempt to settle unless these are initiated by a third party as designated in accordance with Part I, Article 7, in which case they shall be partially settled without any further attempt to settle; (b) in the case of a predefined or standing liquidity transfer order, the order shall be partially settled without any further attempt to settle. Article 7 Processing of cash transfer orders in the event of suspension or termination 1.   Upon termination of a T2S DCA holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB, the ECB shall not accept any new cash transfer orders from that T2S DCA holder. 2.   If a T2S DCA holder is suspended from TARGET-ECB on grounds other than those specified in Part I, Article 24(1), point (a) , the ECB shall store all of that participant’s incoming and outgoing cash transfer orders on its T2S DCA and only submit them for settlement after they have been explicitly accepted by the suspended T2S DCA holder’s CB. 3.   If a T2S DCA holder is suspended from TARGET- ECB on the grounds specified in Part I, Article 24(1), point (a), any outgoing cash transfer orders from that T2S holder’s T2S DCA shall only be processed on the instructions of its representatives, including those appointed by a competent authority or a court, such as the T2S DCA holder’s insolvency administrator, or pursuant to an enforceable decision of a competent authority or a court providing instructions as to how the cash transfer orders are to be processed. All incoming cash transfer orders shall be processed in accordance with paragraph 2. Article 8 No auto-collateralisation No auto-collateralistion is provided to participants in TARGET-ECB. PART V Special terms and conditions for TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) dedicated cash accounts (TIPS DCAs) Article 1 Opening and management of a TIPS DCA 1.   The ECB shall on the request of an MCA holder open and operate one or more TIPS DCAs. 2.   There shall be no debit balance on a TIPS DCA. Article 2 Sending and receiving messages 1.   A TIPS DCA holder may send messages: (a) directly, and/or (b) via one or more instructing parties. 2.   A TIPS DCA holder shall receive messages: (a) directly; or (b) via one instructing party. 3.   Part I, Article 7 shall apply to a TIPS DCA holder that sends or receives messages via an instructing party as though that TIPS DCA holder sends or receives messages directly. Article 3 Reachable parties 1.   A TIPS DCA holder may designate one or more reachable parties. Reachable parties shall have adhered to the SCT Inst scheme by signing the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer Adherence Agreement. 2.   A TIPS DCA holder shall provide evidence to the ECB of each designated reachable party’s adherence to the SCT Inst scheme. 3.   A TIPS DCA holder shall inform the ECB if any designated reachable party no longer adheres to the SCT Inst scheme and shall, without undue delay, take steps to prevent the reachable party from accessing the TIPS DCA. 4.   A TIPS DCA holder may allow its designated reachable parties access via one or more instructing parties. 5.   Part I, Article 7 shall apply to TIPS DCA holders that designate reachable parties. 6.   A TIPS DCA holder that has designated a reachable party shall ensure that at all times that reachable party is available for the purpose of receiving messages. Article 4 Transactions processed on TIPS DCAs 1.   The following transactions shall be processed via a TIPS DCA in TARGET-ECB: (a) instant payment orders; (b) positive recall answers; (c) liquidity transfer orders to TIPS AS technical Accounts, MCAs, T2S DCAs or RTGS DCAs; (d) liquidity transfer orders to sub-accounts; (e) Liquidity transfer orders to overnight deposit accounts. Article 5 Immediate liquidity transfer orders A TIPS DCA holder may submit immediate liquidity transfer orders. Article 6 Processing of cash transfer orders on TIPS DCAs 1.   A timestamp for the processing of cash transfer orders is allocated in the sequence of their receipt. 2.   All cash transfer orders submitted to TARGET-ECB shall be processed following the ‘first in, first out’ (FIFO) principle without prioritisation or reordering. 3.   After an instant payment order has been accepted as set out in Part I, Article 16, TARGET-ECB shall check if sufficient funds are available on the payer’s TIPS DCA to effect settlement and the following shall apply: (a) if sufficient funds are not available, the instant payment order shall be rejected; (b) if sufficient funds are available, the corresponding amount shall be reserved while awaiting the payee’s response. In the event of acceptance by the payee, the instant payment order shall be settled and the reservation shall be simultaneously lifted. In the event of rejection by the payee or the absence of a timely response, within the meaning of the SCT Inst scheme, the instant payment order shall be rejected and the reservation shall be simultaneously lifted. 4.   Funds reserved in accordance with paragraph 3(b) shall not be available for the settlement of subsequent cash transfer orders. 5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3(b), the ECB shall reject an instant payment order if the amount of the instant payment order exceeds any applicable credit memorandum balance (CMB). 6.   After an immediate liquidity transfer order has been accepted as set out in Part I, Article 16, TARGET-ECB shall check if sufficient funds are available on the payer’s TIPS DCA. If sufficient funds are not available the liquidity transfer order shall be rejected. 7.   After a positive recall answer has been accepted as set out in Part I, Article 16, TARGET- ECB shall check if sufficient funds are available on the TIPS DCA to be debited. If sufficient funds are not available the positive recall answer shall be rejected.

In addition, the ECB and other CBs may publish names and BICs of reachable parties designated by TIPS DCA holders and TIPS DCA holders shall ensure that reachable parties have agreed to such publication. Article 9 MPL repository 1.   The central Mobile Proxy Lookup (MPL) repository contains the proxy – IBAN mapping table for the purposes of the MPL service. 2.   Each proxy may be linked to only one IBAN. An IBAN may be linked to one or multiple proxies. 3.   Part I, Article 27 shall apply to the data contained in the MPL repository. Article 10 Processing of cash transfer orders in the event of suspension or extraordinary termination 1.   Upon termination of a TIPS DCA holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB, the ECB shall not accept any new cash transfer orders to or from that TIPS DCA holder. 2.   If a TIPS DCA holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB is suspended on grounds other than those specified in Part I, Article 24(1), point (a), the ECB shall: (a) reject all of its incoming cash transfer orders; (b) reject all of its outgoing cash transfer orders; or (c) reject both its incoming and outgoing cash transfer orders. 3.   If a TIPS DCA holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB is suspended on the grounds specified in Part I, Article 24(1), point (a), the ECB shall reject all of its incoming and outgoing cash transfer orders. 4.   The ECB shall process instant payment orders of a TIPS DCA holder whose participation in TARGET-ECB has been suspended or terminated under Part I, Article 24(1) or (2) and in relation to which the ECB has reserved funds on a TIPS DCA pursuant to Article 6(3), point (b) prior to the suspension or termination. PART VI Special terms and conditions for ancillary systems (AS) using real-time gross settlement ancillary system (RTGS AS) settlement procedures Article 1 Opening and Management of AS technical accounts and use of RTGS AS settlement procedures 1.   The ECB may on the request of an AS open and operate one or more RTGS AS technical accounts to support RTGS AS settlement procedures. 2.   There shall be no debit balance on an RTGS AS technical account. 3.   RTGS AS technical accounts shall not be published in the RTGS directory. 4.   The AS shall select at least one of the following settlement procedures for the purposes of processing AS transfer orders: (a) RTGS AS settlement procedure A; (b) RTGS AS settlement procedure B; (c) RTGS AS settlement procedure C; (d) RTGS AS settlement procedure D; (e) RTGS AS settlement procedure E. 5.   The rules set out in Articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 shall apply to RTGS AS settlement procedures A, B, C, D and E, respectively. 6.   The RTGS AS settlement procedures shall be operational during the times set out in Appendix V. 7.   The AS shall request the ECB to create a settlement bank account group. 8.   The AS shall only send AS transfer orders to accounts included in the settlement bank account group referred to in paragraph 7. Article 2 Priority of AS transfer orders All AS transfer orders shall automatically be assigned the priority ‘urgent’. Article 3 RTGS AS settlement procedure A 1.   The AS shall request a dedicated RTGS AS technical account to support the processing of AS transfer orders using settlement procedure A. The balance on such account shall be zero at the end of the day. 2.   The AS may request the opening of an AS guarantee fund account to support settlement in connection with the ‘settlement period’ service. The balances on the AS guarantee fund account shall be used to settle AS transfer orders in the event that there is insufficient available liquidity on a settlement bank's RTGS DCA. The AS guarantee fund account may be held by the ECB, the AS or an eligible participant. The AS guarantee fund account shall not be published in the RTGS directory. 3.   The AS shall submit AS transfer orders as a batch in a single file in which the sum of debits must balance the sum of credits. 4.   The ECB shall first attempt to settle AS transfer orders that debit the RTGS DCAs of settlement banks and crediting the AS's RTGS AS technical account. Only upon settlement of all such AS transfer orders (including possible funding of the RTGS AS technical account from the AS guarantee fund account) the ECB shall attempt to settle AS transfer orders that debit the RTGS AS technical account and that credit the RTGS DCAs of settlement banks. 5.   If an AS transfer order to debit a settlement bank's RTGS DCA is queued, the ECB shall inform the settlement bank by means of a broadcast message. 6.   If an AS guarantee fund account has been opened and a settlement bank has insufficient funds on its RTGS DCA, the AS may instruct the ECB to activate the guarantee fund mechanism by means of a request to debit the AS guarantee fund account and to credit the RTGS AS technical account. If the AS guarantee fund account does not have sufficient funds to complete settlement, the settlement process shall fail. 7.   If the settlement process fails for any reason, including as referred to in paragraph 6, the ECB shall reject all unsettled AS transfer orders in the single file referred to in paragraph 3 and shall reverse any AS transfer orders that have already been settled. 8.   The AS shall be notified on completion or failure of the settlement. 9.   The AS may opt for the following services: (a) the ‘information period’ service, as referred to in Article 8(1); (b) the ‘settlement period’ service, as referred to in Article 8(3). Article 4 RTGS AS settlement procedure B 1.   The AS shall request a dedicated RTGS AS technical account to support the processing of AS transfer orders using settlement procedure B. The balance on such account shall be zero at the end of day. 2.   The AS may request the opening of an AS guarantee fund account to support settlement in connection with the ‘settlement period’ service. The balances on the AS guarantee fund account shall be used to settle the AS transfer orders in the event that there is insufficient available liquidity on a settlement bank's RTGS DCA. The AS guarantee fund account may be held by the ECB, the AS or an eligible participant. The AS guarantee fund account shall not be published in the RTGS directory. 3.   The AS shall submit AS transfer orders as a batch in a single file in which the sum of debits must balance the sum of credits. 4.   Settlement procedure B operates on an ‘all-or-nothing’ basis. The ECB shall attempt to simultaneously settle all AS transfer orders that debit the RTGS DCAs of settlement banks and credit the AS’s RTGS AS technical account, and all AS transfer orders that debit the RTGS AS technical account and credit the RTGS DCAs of settlement banks. If one or more of the AS transfer orders cannot be settled, all AS transfer orders shall be queued and an optimisation algorithm shall be applied, and the settlement banks shall be informed. 5.   If an AS guarantee fund account has been opened and a settlement bank has insufficient funds on its RTGS DCA, the AS may instruct the ECB to activate the guarantee fund mechanism by means of a request to debit the AS guarantee fund account and to credit the RTGS AS technical account. If the AS guarantee fund account does not have sufficient funds to complete settlement, the settlement process shall fail. 6.   If the settlement process fails for any reason, including as referred to in paragraph 5, the ECB shall reject all unsettled AS transfer orders in the single file referred to in paragraph 3. 7.   The AS shall be notified on completion or failure of the settlement. 8.   The AS may opt for the following services: (a) the ‘information period’ service, as referred to in Article 8(1); (b) the ‘settlement period’ service, as referred to in Article 8(3). Article 5 RTGS AS settlement procedure C 1.   Settlement procedure C supports settlement using dedicated liquidity on sub-accounts. The AS shall request a dedicated RTGS AS technical account to support the processing of AS transfer orders using settlement procedure C. The balance on such account shall be zero at the end of the day. This RTGS AS technical account may also be used to support the processing of AS transfer orders using settlement procedure E. 2.   The AS shall ensure that each settlement bank opens at least one sub-account that is only to be used by the AS for the purposes of this settlement procedure. 3.   The ECB shall start a mandatory settlement procedure C automatically on each TARGET business day according to the schedule set out in Appendix V, that shall trigger the settlement of those standing liquidity transfer orders set up for mandatory settlement procedure C by debiting the RTGS DCAs of the settlement banks and crediting the sub-account referred to in paragraph 2. 4.   Settlement procedure C shall close by means of an end-of-procedure message, which may be sent by the AS at any time prior to the cut-off time for interbank payments as set out in Appendix V. If the AS does not send the end-of-procedure message by that cut-off time, the ECB shall close the procedure at that cut-off time. 5.   The closure of the mandatory settlement procedure C leads to an automatic transfer of liquidity from the sub-account referred to in paragraph 2 to the RTGS DCA. 6.   If the mandatory settlement procedure C is closed, the AS may start an optional procedure at any time before the cut-off time for interbank payments as set out in Appendix V, that shall trigger the settlement of those standing liquidity transfer orders set up for optional settlement procedure C by debiting the settlement bank’s RTGS DCA and crediting its RTGS sub-account. The AS may start and close one or several successive optional procedures before the cut-off time for interbank payments. The closure of an optional settlement procedure C leads to an automatic transfer of liquidity from the sub-account referred to in paragraph 2 to the RTGS DCA. 7.   The mandatory settlement procedure C and any subsequent optional settlement procedure C may consist of one or several cycles. 8.   The AS may, at any time after the start of a mandatory or optional settlement procedure C, start a cycle by means of a ‘start-of-cycle’ message. After the start of the cycle, liquidity transfers from the sub-account referred to in paragraph 2 may not be made until an ‘end-of-cycle’ message is sent by the AS. The balance can be changed during the cycle as a result of cross-system settlement payments or if a settlement bank transfers liquidity to its sub-account. The ECB shall notify the AS of the reduction or increase of liquidity on the sub-account as a result of cross-system settlement payments. If the AS so requests, the ECB shall also notify it of the increased liquidity on the sub-account as a result of liquidity transfer orders by the settlement bank. 9.   The AS may submit AS transfer orders as a batch in one or several files while the cycle is open. The cash transfer orders may be for any of the following transactions: (a) the debit of the sub-account of settlement banks and credit of the RTGS AS technical account; (b) the debit of the RTGS AS technical account and credit of the sub-accounts of settlement banks; (c) the debit of the RTGS AS technical account and credit of the RTGS DCAs of settlement banks. 10.   The ECB shall immediately settle those AS transfer orders that can be settled. AS transfer orders that cannot be settled immediately shall be queued and an optimisation algorithm shall be applied. Any AS transfer orders which remain unsettled at the time the cycle is closed shall be rejected. 11.   The AS shall be notified at the latest by the end of the cycle of the status of the individual AS transfer orders. Article 6 RTGS AS settlement procedure D 1.   RTGS AS Settlement procedure D supports settlement with the use of pre-funding. The AS shall request a dedicated RTGS AS technical account to support the processing of AS transfer orders using settlement procedure D. 2.   The RTGS AS technical accounts shall only have a zero balance or a positive balance. Liquidity may remain on the RTGS AS technical account overnight whereupon it will be subject to remuneration as set out in Part I, Article 12(2). 3.   The ECB shall notify the AS of liquidity transfers debiting the RTGS DCAs of the settlement banks and crediting the RTGS AS technical account. These liquidity transfers may be made on each TARGET business day according to the schedule set out in Appendix V. The AS may input immediate liquidity transfer orders that debit the RTGS AS technical account and credit the RTGS DCAs of the settlement banks. Article 7 RTGS AS settlement procedure E 1.   RTGS AS Settlement procedure E supports bilateral settlement and the individual processing of AS transfer orders. The AS may use Settlement Procedure E without an RTGS AS technical account for bilateral settlement. The AS shall request an RTGS AS technical account to support the processing of AS transfer orders using settlement procedure E if it opts for the individual processing of AS transfer orders. The balance on this RTGS AS technical account shall be zero at the end of the day. This RTGS AS technical account may also be used for settlement procedure C. 2.   The AS may submit AS transfer orders as a batch in one or several files between: (a) the RTGS DCAs of the settlement banks and the RTGS AS technical account if used; and (b) the RTGS DCAs of the settlement banks. The AS shall be responsible for ensuring the correct sequencing of AS transfer orders in the file to ensure smooth settlement. 3.   The ECB shall settle immediately those AS transfer orders that can be settled. AS transfer orders that cannot be settled immediately shall be queued. If an AS transfer order to debit a settlement bank's RTGS DCA is queued, the settlement bank shall be informed via a broadcast message. 4.   The AS may opt for the following services: (a) the ‘information period’ service, as referred to in Article 8(1); (b) the ‘settlement period’ service, as referred to in Article 8(3). 5.   The AS shall be notified of the status of the individual AS transfer orders submitted. Article 8 Information period and settlement period 1.   The ‘information period’ service allows the AS to inform its settlement banks of the liquidity needed to ensure successful settlement. This optional service allows the AS to define a period before the start of the settlement of the AS transfer orders. During that period, and at the request of the settlement bank, the AS may revoke either single AS transfer orders (for RTGS AS settlement procedure E) or files (for RTGS AS settlement procedures A and B). The AS may also request the ECB to perform such revocation on its behalf. 2.   In the event that an AS, or the ECB on its behalf, revokes single AS transfer orders (for RTGS AS settlement Procedure E) or files (for RTGS AS settlement procedures A and B) during the ‘information period’, the processing of the AS transfer orders shall be cancelled. 3.   The ‘settlement period’ service allows the AS to define a period until which the settlement of the AS transfer orders can take place. This service is a prerequisite for the use of a guarantee fund account, and is optional for the use of AS technical accounts. 4.   During the ‘settlement period’ the AS, or the ECB on its behalf, may revoke either single AS transfer orders (for RTGS AS settlement procedure E) or files (for RTGS AS settlement procedures A and B) that do not have a final status and the following shall apply: (a) if RTGS AS settlement procedure E is used for bilateral settlement, the relevant AS transfer orders shall be reversed; (b) if RTGS AS settlement procedure E is not used for bilateral settlement, or if in RTGS AS settlement procedure A the entire settlement fails, any settled AS transfer orders in the file shall be reversed and all settlement banks and the AS shall be informed via a broadcast message. (c) if RTGS AS settlement procedure B is used, the entire settlement fails and all settlement banks and the AS shall be informed via a broadcast message. Article 9 Cross system settlement 1.   Cross-system settlement allows an AS to credit the RTGS AS technical account of another AS or sub-account of a settlement bank of another AS and is available for AS using RTGS AS settlement procedure C or D. 2.   The ECB shall, on the request of the AS, allow cross-system settlement between that AS and another AS in TARGET-ECB or another TARGET component system. The requesting AS shall provide the ECB with the authorisation of the other AS. 3.   A cross-system settlement may only be initiated if the two AS have opened a settlement procedure. Furthermore, if the cross-system settlement is initiated by an AS using RTGS AS settlement procedure C, a settlement cycle must also be open for that AS. 4.   An AS using RTGS AS settlement procedure C in the context of cross-system settlement shall only submit AS transfer orders individually that debit the sub-account of one of its AS settlement banks. These AS transfer orders would credit the sub-account of the receiving AS settlement bank if that receiving AS is using RTGS AS settlement procedure C, or would credit the RTGS AS technical account of the receiving AS if that AS is using RTGS AS settlement procedure D. 5.   An AS using RTGS AS settlement procedure D in the context of cross-system settlement shall only submit AS transfer orders individually that debit its RTGS AS technical account. These AS transfer orders would credit the sub-account of the receiving AS settlement bank if that receiving AS is using RTGS AS settlement procedure C, or would credit the RTGS AS technical account of the receiving AS if that AS is using RTGS AS settlement procedure D. Both AS using cross-system settlement shall be notified via a broadcast message of the settlement or rejection of the AS transfer orders. Article 10 Effect of suspension or termination If the suspension or termination of the use of the AS settlement procedures by an AS occurs during the settlement cycle of AS transfer orders, the ECB may complete the settlement cycle. PART VII Special terms and conditions for ancillary systems using the TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) ancillary system settlement procedure (TIPS AS settlement procedure) Article 1 Opening and management of a TIPS AS technical account 1.   The ECB may on the request of an AS that settles instant payments pursuant to the SCT Inst scheme or near instant payments in its own books, open and operate one or more TIPS AS technical accounts. 2.   There shall be no debit balance on a TIPS AS technical account. 3.   The ancillary system shall use a TIPS AS technical account to collect the necessary liquidity set aside by its clearing members to fund their positions. 4.   The ancillary system may opt to receive notifications of the crediting and debiting of its TIPS AS technical account. If the ancillary system opts for this service notification is provided immediately upon the debit or credit of the TIPS AS technical account. 5.   An ancillary system may send instant payment orders, and positive recall answers to any TIPS DCA holder or TIPS AS. A ancillary system shall receive and process instant payment orders, recall requests and positive recall answers from any TIPS DCA holder or TIPS AS.

In the event of acceptance by the payee, the instant payment order shall be settled and the reservation shall be simultaneously lifted. In the event of rejection by the payee or the absence of a timely response, within the meaning of the SCT Inst scheme, the instant payment order shall be rejected and the reservation shall be simultaneously lifted. 4.   Funds reserved in accordance with paragraph 3(b) shall not be available for the settlement of subsequent cash transfer orders. 5.   Without prejudice to paragraph 3(b), the ECB shall reject an instant payment order if the amount of the instant payment order exceeds any applicable credit memorandum balance (CMB). 6.   After a liquidity transfer order from a TIPS AS technical account to a TIPS DCA has been accepted as set out in Part I, Article 17(1), the ECB shall check if sufficient funds are available on the payer’s TIPS AS technical account. If sufficient funds are not available the liquidity transfer order shall be rejected. If sufficient funds are available the liquidity transfer order shall be settled immediately. 7.   After a positive recall answer has been accepted as set out in Part I, Article 17, the ECB shall check if sufficient funds are available on the TIPS AS technical account to be debited. If sufficient funds are not available the positive recall answer shall be rejected. If sufficient funds are available the positive recall answer shall be settled immediately. 8.   Without prejudice to paragraph 7, the ECB shall reject positive recall answers if the amount of the positive recall answer exceeds any applicable CMB. Article 5 Recall request 1.   A TIPS AS technical account holder may submit a recall request. 2.   The recall request shall be forwarded to the payee of the settled instant payment order which may answer with a positive or negative recall answer. Article 6 TIPS AS settlement procedure The TIPS AS settlement procedure shall be operational during the times set out in Appendix V. Article 7 Reachable parties via a TIPS AS technical account 1.   A TIPS AS technical account holder may designate one or more reachable parties. Reachable parties shall have adhered to the SCT Inst scheme signing the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer Adherence Agreement. 2.   A TIPS AS technical account holder shall provide evidence to the ECB of each designated reachable party’s adherence to the SCT Inst scheme. 3.   A TIPS AS technical account holder shall inform the ECB if any designated reachable party no longer adheres to the SCT Inst scheme and shall, without undue delay, take steps to prevent the reachable party from accessing the TIPS AS technical account. 4.   A TIPS AS technical account holder may allow its designated reachable parties access via one or more instructing parties. 5.   Part I, Article 7 shall apply to an AS that has designated reachable parties. 6.   A TIPS AS technical account holder that has designated a reachable party shall ensure that reachable party is at all times available for the purpose of receiving messages. Article 8 Transactions processed on TIPS AS technical accounts 1.   The following transactions shall be processed via a TIPS AS technical account in TARGET-ECB: (a) instant payment orders; (b) positive recall answers; (c) liquidity transfer orders to TIPS DCAs. Article 9 TIPS directory 1.   The TIPS directory is a list of BICs used for the purpose of routing information and comprises the BICS of: (a) TIPS DCA holders; (b) reachable parties; 2.   The TIPS directory shall be updated daily. 3.   TIPS AS technical account holders may only distribute the TIPS directory to their designated reachable parties and their instructing parties. Reachable parties may only distribute the TIPS directory to their branches. 4.   A specific BIC shall only appear once in the TIPS directory. 5.   TIPS AS technical account holders acknowledge that the ECB and other CBs may publish names and BICs of reachable parties designated by the TIPS AS technical account holders and TIPS AS technical account holders shall ensure that reachable parties have agreed to such publication. Article 10 MPL repository 1.   The central Mobile Proxy Lookup (MPL) repository contains the proxy – IBAN mapping table for the purposes of the MPL service. 2.   Each proxy may be linked to only one IBAN. An IBAN may be linked to one or multiple proxies. 3.   Part I, Article 28 shall apply to the data contained in the MPL repository. Article 11 Processing of cash transfer orders in the event of suspension or extraordinary termination 1.   Upon termination of a TIPS AS technical account holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB, the ECB shall not accept any new cash transfer orders to or from that TIPS AS technical account holder. 2.   If a TIPS AS technical account holders’ participation in TARGET-ECB is suspended on grounds other than those specified in Part I, Article 24(1), point (a), the ECB shall: (a) reject all of its incoming cash transfer orders; (b) reject all of its outgoing cash transfer orders; or (c) reject both its incoming and outgoing cash transfer orders. 3.   If a TIPS AS Technical Account Holder’s participation in TARGET-ECB is suspended on the grounds specified in Part I, Article 24(1), point (a), the suspended TIPS AS technical account holder’s CB shall reject all of its incoming and outgoing sash transfer orders. 4.   The ECB shall process instant payment orders of a TIPS AS technical account holder whose participation in TARGET-ECB has been suspended or terminated under Part I, Article 24(1) or (2) and in relation to which the ECB has reserved funds on a TIPS AS technical account pursuant to Article 4(3), point (b) prior to the suspension or termination.

Double-entry check All cash transfer orders shall pass a double-entry check, the aim of which is to reject orders that have been submitted more than once (duplicated cash transfer orders). Details can be found in Part I, Section 3 of the relevant UDFS. 6. Validation rules and error codes Validation of messages is carried out according to High Value Payments Plus (HVPS+) guidelines on message validations specified by the ISO 20022 standard, and TARGET-specific validations. The detailed validation rules and error codes are described in the respective parts of the UDFS as follows: (a) for MCAs, in Chapter 14 of the CLM UDFS; (b) for RTGS DCAs, in Chapter 13 of the RTGS UDFS; (c) for T2S DCAs, in Chapter 4.1 of the T2S UDFS. If an instant payment order or a positive recall answer is rejected for any reason, the TIPS DCA holder shall receive a payment status report [pacs.002], as described in Chapter 4.2 of the TIPS UDFS. If a liquidity transfer order is rejected for any reason, the TIPS DCA holder shall receive a rejection [camt.025], as described in Chapter 1.6 of the TIPS UDFS. 7. Predetermined settlement times and events RTGS DCAs (a) For payment orders using the Earliest Debit Time Indicator, the message element ‘/FromTime/’ shall be used. (b) For payment orders using the Latest Debit Time Indicator, two options shall be available. (i) Message element ‘RejectTime’: if the payment order cannot be settled by the indicated debit time, the cash transfer order shall be rejected. (ii) Message element ‘TillTime’: if the payment order cannot be settled by the indicated debit time, the cash transfer order shall not be rejected but shall be kept in the relevant queue. Under both options, if a payment order with a Latest Debit Time Indicator is not settled 15 minutes prior to the time indicated therein, a notification shall automatically be sent via the GUI. T2S DCAs (a) For immediate liquidity transfer orders, no specific XML tag is required; (b) Predefined liquidity transfer orders and standing liquidity transfer orders may be triggered by a specific time or event on the day of settlement: (i) for settlement at a specific time, the XML tag ‘Time(/ExctnTp/Tm/)’ shall be used, (ii) for settlement upon occurrence of a specific event, the XML tag ‘(EventType/ExctnTp/Evt/)’ shall be used. (c) the validity period for standing liquidity transfer orders shall be set by the following XML tags: ‘FromDate/VldtyPrd/FrDt/’ and ‘ToDate/VldtyPrd/ToDt/’. 8. Offsetting of cash transfer orders on RTGS DCAs Offsetting checks and, if appropriate, extended offsetting checks (both terms as defined in subparagraphs a) and b) shall be carried out on cash transfer orders to facilitate the smooth settlement. (a) An offsetting check shall determine whether the payee’s cash transfer orders that are at the front of the queue for cash transfer orders with the priority ‘urgent’ or, if inapplicable, ’high’ are available to be offset against the payer’s cash transfer order (hereinafter ‘offsetting cash transfer orders’). If an offsetting cash transfer order does not provide sufficient funds for the respective payer’s cash transfer order it shall be determined whether there is sufficient available liquidity on the payer’s RTGS DCA. (b) If the offsetting check fails, the ECB may apply an extended offsetting check. An extended offsetting check determines whether offsetting cash transfer orders are available in any of the payee’s queues regardless of when they joined the queue. However, if in the queue of the payee there are higher priority cash transfer orders addressed to other participants, the FIFO principle may only be breached if settling such an offsetting cash transfer order would result in a liquidity increase for the payee. 9. Optimisation algorithms on RTGS DCAs and sub-accounts Four algorithms shall be applied to facilitate the smooth settlement of payment flows. Further information is available in the RTGS UDFS Part 2. (a) Under the ‘ partial optimisation’ algorithm the ECB shall: (i) calculate and check the liquidity positions, limits and reservations of each relevant RTGS DCA; and (ii) if the total liquidity position of one or more relevant RTGS DCA is negative, extract single payment orders until the total liquidity position of each relevant RTGS DCA is positive. Thereafter, the ECB and the other CBs involved shall, provided there are sufficient funds, settle the relevant remaining cash transfer orders (except the extracted payment orders described in point (ii)) simultaneously on the RTGS DCAs of the participants concerned. When extracting payment orders, the ECB shall start from the participant’s RTGS DCA with the highest negative total liquidity position and from the payment order at the end of the queue with the lowest priority. The selection process shall only run for a short time, to be determined by the ECB at its discretion. (b) Under the ‘ multiple optimisation’ algorithm the ECB shall: (i) compare pairs of participants’ RTGS DCAs to determine whether queued payment orders can be settled within the available liquidity of the two participants’ RTGS DCAs concerned and within the limits set by them (by starting from the pair of RTGS DCAs with the smallest difference between the payment orders addressed to each other), and the CBs involved shall book those payments simultaneously on the two participants’ RTGS DCAs; and (ii) if, in relation to a pair of RTGS DCAs as described in point (i), liquidity is insufficient to fund the bilateral position, extract single payment orders until there is sufficient liquidity. In this case the CBs involved shall settle the remaining payments, except the extracted ones, simultaneously on the two participants’ RTGS DCAs. After performing the checks specified in points (i) to (ii), the ECB shall check the multilateral settlement positions (between a participant’s RTGS DCA and other participants’ RTGS DCAs in relation to which a multilateral limit has been set). For this purpose, the procedure described under subparagraphs (i) to (ii) shall apply mutatis mutandis. (c) Under the algorithm ‘ partial optimisation with AS’ which supports settlement procedure B, the ECB shall follow the same procedure as for the partial optimisation algorithm, but without extracting AS transfer orders (for an AS which settles on a simultaneous multilateral basis i.e. RTGS AS settlement procedure B). (d) The algorithm ‘ optimisation on sub-accounts’ is used to optimise the settlement of urgent priority AS transfer orders on participants’ sub-accounts. When using this algorithm the ECB shall calculate the total liquidity position of each participant’s sub-account by establishing whether the aggregate of all outgoing and incoming AS transfer orders pending in the queue is negative or positive. If the outcome of these calculations and checks is positive for each relevant sub-account, the ECB and other CBs involved shall settle all cash transfers simultaneously on the sub-accounts of the participants concerned. If the outcome of these calculations and checks is negative no settlement shall take place. Furthermore, this algorithm does not take account of any limits or reservations. For each settlement bank the total position is calculated and, if the positions for all settlement banks are covered, all transactions shall be settled. Transactions which are not covered are returned to the queue. (e) Cash transfer orders entered after the multiple optimisation algorithm, the partial optimisation algorithm or the partial optimisation with AS algorithm has started may nevertheless be settled immediately if the positions and limits of the participants’ RTGS DCAs concerned are compatible with both the settlement of these orders and the settlement of cash transfer orders in the current optimisation procedure. (f) The partial optimisation algorithm and the multiple optimisation algorithm shall be run sequentially in that order. They shall not be run if RTGS AS settlement procedure B is running. (g) The algorithms shall run flexibly by setting a pre-defined time lag between the application of different algorithms to ensure a minimum interval between the running of two algorithms. The time sequence shall be automatically controlled. Manual intervention shall be possible. (h) While included in a running algorithm, a payment order shall not be reordered (change of the position in a queue) or revoked. Requests for reordering or revocation of a payment order shall be queued until the algorithm is complete. If the payment order concerned is settled while the algorithm is running, any request to reorder or revoke shall be rejected. If the payment order is not settled, the participant’s requests shall be taken into account immediately. 10. Connectivity Participants shall connect to TARGET using one of the following modes. (a) The user to application (U2A) mode: in the U2A mode, participants connect via a GUI which allows users to perform business functions based on their respective access rights. It allows users to enter and maintain business data as well as to retrieve business information. The relevant User Handbook (UHB) provides exhaustive information on each of the business functions that the respective GUI provides. (b) The application to application (A2A) mode: in A2A mode software applications communicate with TARGET by exchanging single messages and files based on their respective access rights and message subscription and routing configuration. The A2A communication relies on XML messages, using the ISO 20022 standard where applicable, for both inbound and outbound communication. The modes of connection are described in further detail in the ESMIG UDFS. 11. The UDFS and the User Handbook Further details and examples explaining the above rules are contained in the respective UDFS and the User Handbooks for each service, as amended from time to time and published on the ECB’s website in English. ( 1 ) For sub-accounts this section must start with the 3-character AS code as defined by the central bank. APPENDIX II TARGET COMPENSATION SCHEME 1. General principles (a) If there is a technical malfunction of TARGET, participants may submit claims for compensation in accordance with the TARGET compensation scheme laid down in this Appendix. (b) Unless otherwise decided by the ECB’s Governing Council, the TARGET compensation scheme shall not apply if the technical malfunction of TARGET arises out of external events beyond the reasonable control of the CBs concerned or as a result of acts or omissions by third parties. (c) Compensation under the TARGET compensation scheme shall be the only compensation procedure offered in the event of a technical malfunction of TARGET. Participants may, however, use other legal means to claim for losses. If a participant accepts a compensation offer under the TARGET compensation scheme, this shall constitute the participant’s irrevocable agreement that it thereby waives all claims in relation to the cash transfer orders concerning which it accepts compensation (including any claims for consequential loss) it may have against any CB, and that the receipt by it of the corresponding compensation payment constitutes full and final settlement of all such claims. The participant shall indemnify the CBs concerned, up to a maximum of the amount received under the TARGET compensation scheme, in respect of any further claims which are raised by any other participant or any other third party in relation to the cash transfer order or cash transfer concerned. (d) The making of a compensation offer shall not constitute an admission of liability by the ECB or any other CB in respect of a technical malfunction of TARGET. 2. Conditions for compensation offers (a) A payer may submit a claim for an administration fee and interest compensation if, due to a technical malfunction of TARGET cash transfer order was not settled on the business day on which it was accepted. (b) A payee may submit a claim for an administration fee if due to a technical malfunction of TARGET it did not receive a cash transfer that it was expecting to receive on a particular business day. The payee may also submit a claim for interest compensation if one or more of the following conditions are met: (i) in the case of participants that have access to the marginal lending facility: due to a technical malfunction of TARGET, a payee had recourse to the marginal lending facility; and/or (ii) in the case of all participants: it was technically impossible to have recourse to the money market or such refinancing was impossible on other, objectively reasonable grounds. 3. Calculation of compensation (a) With respect to a compensation offer for a payer: (i) the administration fee shall be EUR 50 for the first non-settled cash transfer order, EUR 25 for each of the next four such cash transfer orders and EUR 12,50 for each further such cash transfer order. The administration fee shall be calculated separately in relation to each payee; (ii) interest compensation shall be determined by applying a reference rate to be fixed from day to day. This reference rate shall be the lower of the euro short term reference rate (€STR) rate and the marginal lending facility rate. The reference rate shall be applied to the amount of the cash transfer order not settled as a result of the technical malfunction of TARGET for each day in the period from the date of the actual or, in relation to cash transfer orders referred to in paragraph 2(b)(ii), intended submission of the cash transfer order until the date on which the cash transfer order was or could have been successfully settled. Any interest or charges resulting from the placing of any nonsettled cash transfer orders on deposit with the Eurosystem shall be deducted from, or charged to, the amount of any compensation, as the case may be; (iii) no interest compensation shall be payable if and in so far as funds resulting from nonsettled cash transfer orders were placed in the market or used to fulfil minimum reserve requirements. (b) With respect to a compensation offer for a payee: (i) the administration fee shall be EUR 50 for the first non-settled cash transfer order, EUR 25 for each of the next four such cash transfer orders and EUR 12,50 for each further such cash transfer order. The administration fee shall be calculated separately in relation to each payer; (ii) the method set out in subparagraph (a)(ii) for calculating interest compensation shall apply except that interest compensation shall be payable at a rate equal to the difference between the marginal lending facility rate and the reference rate, and shall be calculated on the amount of any recourse to the marginal lending facility occurring as a result of the technical malfunction of TARGET. 4. Procedural rules (a) A claim for compensation shall be submitted on the claim form available on the website of the ECB (see https://www.ecb.europa.eu). Payers shall submit a separate claim form in respect of each payee and payees shall submit a separate claim form in respect of each payer. Sufficient additional information and documents shall be provided to support the information indicated in the claim form. Only one claim may be submitted in relation to a specific payment or payment order. (b) Within four weeks of a technical malfunction of TARGET, participants shall submit their claim forms to the ECB. Any additional information and evidence requested by the ECB shall be supplied within two weeks of such request being made. (c) The ECB shall review the claims and forward them to the ECB. Unless otherwise decided by the ECB’s Governing Council and communicated to the participants, all received claims shall be assessed no later than 14 weeks after the technical malfunction of TARGET occurs. (d) The ECB shall communicate the result of the assessment referred to in subparagraph (c) to the relevant participants. If the assessment entails a compensation offer, the participants concerned shall, within four weeks of the communication of such offer, either accept or reject it, in respect of each cash transfer order comprised within each claim, by signing a standard letter of acceptance (in the form available on the website of the ECB (see https://www.ecb.europa.eu). If such letter has not been received by the ECB within four weeks, the participants concerned shall be deemed to have rejected the compensation offer. (e) The ECB shall make compensation payments on receipt of a participant’s letter of acceptance of compensation. No interest shall be payable on any compensation payment.

Change of operating hours (a) When changing the TARGET operating schedule as provided for in Part I, Article 18(2) of these Conditions, the ECB may delay the cut off times of TARGET for a given business day or delay the start of the following business day, or change the timing of any other event listed in Appendix V. (b) The cut off times of TARGET for a given business day may be delayed if a TARGET failure has occurred during that day but has been resolved before 18:00. Such a closing time delay should not normally exceed two hours and shall be announced as early as possible to participants. (c) Once a delay of the cut off times of TARGET is announced, it may be further delayed but may not be withdrawn. 1.4. Other provisions (a) In the event of a failure of the ECB, some or all of its technical functions in relation to TARGET-[insert CB/country reference] may be performed by other Eurosystem CBs or by the Level 3 NCBs on its behalf. (b) The ECB may require that the participants participate in regular or ad hoc testing of business continuity and contingency processing measures, training or any other preventative arrangements, as deemed necessary by the ECB. Any costs incurred by the participants as a result of such testing or other arrangements shall be borne solely by the participants. 2.   BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND CONTINGENCY PROCEDURES (RTGS DCA AND RTGS AS SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES) In addition to the provisions set out in section 1, the provisions set out in this section 2 shall apply specifically to RTGS DCA holders and AS that make use of the RTGS AS settlement procedures. 2.1.

APPENDIX VII REQUIREMENTS REGARDING INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT MCA HOLDERS, T2S DCA HOLDERS AND TIPS DCA HOLDERS These requirements regarding information security management or business continuity management shall not apply to MCA holders, T2S DCA holders and TIPS DCA holders. RTGS DCA HOLDERS AND AS The requirements set out in section 1 of this Appendix VII (information security management) shall apply to all RTGS DCA holders and AS, except where an RTGS DCA holder or an AS demonstrates that a specific requirement is not applicable to it. In establishing the scope of application of the requirements within its infrastructure, the participant should identify the elements that are part of the Payment Transaction Chain (PTC). Specifically, the PTC starts at a Point of Entry (PoE), i.e. a system involved in the creation of transactions (e.g. workstations, front-office and back-office applications, middleware), and ends at the system responsible to send the message to the NSP. The requirements set out in section 2 of this Appendix VII (business continuity management) shall apply to RTGS DCA holders and AS designated by the Eurosystem as being critical for the smooth functioning of the TARGET system on the basis of criteria periodically updated and published on the ECB’s website. 1. Information security management Requirement 1.1: Information security policy The management shall set a clear policy direction in line with business objectives and demonstrate support for and commitment to information security through the issuance, approval and maintenance of an information security policy aiming at managing information security and cyber resilience across the organisation in terms of identification, assessment and treatment of information security and cyber resilience risks. The policy should contain at least the following sections: objectives, scope (including domains such as organisation, human resources, asset management etc.), principles and allocation of responsibilities. Requirement 1.2: Internal organisation An information security framework shall be established to implement the information security policy within the organisation. The management shall coordinate and review the establishment of the information security framework to ensure the implementation of the information security policy (as per Requirement 1.1) across the organisation, including the allocation of sufficient resources and assignment of security responsibilities for this purpose. Requirement 1.3: External parties The security of the organisation’s information and information processing facilities should not be reduced by the introduction of, and/or the dependence on, an external party/parties or products/services provided by them. Any access to the organisation’s information processing facilities by external parties shall be controlled. When external parties or products/services of external parties are required to access the organisation’s information processing facilities, a risk assessment shall be carried out to determine the security implications and control requirements. Controls shall be agreed and defined in an agreement with each relevant external party. Requirement 1.4: Asset management All information assets, the business processes and the underlying information systems, such as operating systems, infrastructures, business applications, off-the-shelf products, services and user-developed applications, in the scope of the Payment Transaction Chain shall be accounted for and have a nominated owner. The responsibility for the maintenance and the operation of appropriate controls in the business processes and the related IT components to safeguard the information assets shall be assigned. Note: the owner can delegate the implementation of specific controls as appropriate, but remains accountable for the proper protection of the assets. Requirement 1.5: Information assets classification Information assets shall be classified in terms of their criticality to the smooth delivery of the service by the participant. The classification shall indicate the need, priorities and degree of protection required when handling the information asset in the relevant business processes and shall also take into consideration the underlying IT components. An information asset classification scheme approved by the management shall be used to define an appropriate set of protection controls throughout the information asset lifecycle (including removal and destruction of information assets) and to communicate the need for specific handling measures. Requirement 1.6: Human resources security Security responsibilities shall be addressed prior to employment in adequate job descriptions and in terms and conditions of employment. All candidates for employment, contractors and third-party users shall be adequately screened, especially for sensitive jobs. Employees, contractors and third-party users of information processing facilities shall sign an agreement on their security roles and responsibilities. An adequate level of awareness shall be ensured among all employees, contractors and third-party users, and education and training in security procedures and the correct use of information processing facilities shall be provided to them to minimise possible security risks. A formal disciplinary process for handling security breaches shall be established for employees. Responsibilities shall be in place to ensure that an employee’s, contractor’s or third-party user’s exit from or transfer within the organisation is managed, and that the return of all equipment and the removal of all access rights are completed. Requirement 1.7: Physical and environmental security Critical or sensitive information processing facilities shall be housed in secure areas, protected by defined security perimeters, with appropriate security barriers and entry controls. They shall be physically protected from unauthorised access, damage and interference. Access shall be granted only to individuals who fall within the scope of Requirement 1.6. Procedures and standards shall be established to protect physical media containing information assets when in transit. Equipment shall be protected from physical and environmental threats. Protection of equipment (including equipment used off-site) and against the removal of property is necessary to reduce the risk of unauthorised access to information and to guard against loss or damage of equipment or information. Special measures may be required to protect against physical threats and to safeguard supporting facilities such as the electrical supply and cabling infrastructure. Requirement 1.8: Operations management Responsibilities and procedures shall be established for the management and operation of information processing facilities covering all the underlying systems in the Payment Transaction Chain end-to-end. As regards operating procedures, including technical administration of IT systems, segregation of duties shall be implemented, where appropriate, to reduce the risk of negligent or deliberate system misuse. Where segregation of duties cannot be implemented due to documented objective reasons, compensatory controls shall be implemented following a formal risk analysis. Controls shall be established to prevent and detect the introduction of malicious code for systems in the Payment Transaction Chain. Controls shall be also established (including user awareness) to prevent, detect and remove malicious code. Mobile code shall be used only from trusted sources (e.g. signed Microsoft COM components and Java Applets). The configuration of the browser (e.g. the use of extensions and plugins) shall be strictly controlled. Data backup and recovery policies shall be implemented by the management; those recovery policies shall include a plan of the restoration process which is tested at regular intervals at least annually. Systems that are critical for the security of payments shall be monitored and events relevant to information security shall be recorded. Operator logs shall be used to ensure that information system problems are identified. Operator logs shall be regularly reviewed on a sample basis, based on the criticality of the operations. System monitoring shall be used to check the effectiveness of controls which are identified as critical for the security of payments and to verify conformity to an access policy model. Exchanges of information between organisations shall be based on a formal exchange policy, carried out in line with exchange agreements among the involved parties and shall be compliant with any relevant legislation. Third party software components employed in the exchange of information with TARGET (e.g. software received from a Service Bureau) must be used under a formal agreement with the third party. Requirement 1.9: Access control Access to information assets shall be justified on the basis of business requirements (need-to-know ( 1 ) ) and according to the established framework of corporate policies (including the information security policy). Clear access control rules shall be defined based on the principle of least privilege ( 2 ) to reflect closely the needs of the corresponding business and IT processes. Where relevant, (e.g. for backup management) logical access control should be consistent with physical access control unless there are adequate compensatory controls in place (e.g. encryption, personal data anonymisation). Formal and documented procedures shall be in place to control the allocation of access rights to information systems and services that fall within the scope of the Payment Transaction Chain. The procedures shall cover all stages in the lifecycle of user access, from the initial registration of new users to the final deregistration of users that no longer require access. Special attention shall be given, where appropriate, to the allocation of access rights of such criticality that the abuse of those access rights could lead to a severe adverse impact on the operations of the participant (e.g. access rights allowing system administration, override of system controls, direct access to business data). Appropriate controls shall be put in place to identify, authenticate and authorise users at specific points in the organisation’s network, e.g. for local and remote access to systems in the Payment Transaction Chain. Personal accounts shall not be shared in order to ensure accountability. For passwords, rules shall be established and enforced by specific controls to ensure that passwords cannot be easily guessed, e.g. complexity rules and limited-time validity. A safe password recovery and/or reset protocol shall be established. A policy shall be developed and implemented on the use of cryptographic controls to protect the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of information. A key management policy shall be established to support the use of cryptographic controls. There shall be policy for viewing confidential information on screen or in print (e.g. a clear screen, a clear desk policy) to reduce the risk of unauthorised access. When working remotely, the risks of working in an unprotected environment shall be considered and appropriate technical and organisational controls shall be applied. Requirement 1.10: Information systems acquisition, development and maintenance Security requirements shall be identified and agreed prior to the development and/or implementation of information systems. Appropriate controls shall be built into applications, including user-developed applications, to ensure correct processing. These controls shall include the validation of input data, internal processing and output data. Additional controls may be required for systems that process, or have an impact on, sensitive, valuable or critical information. Such controls shall be determined on the basis of security requirements and risk assessment according to the established policies (e.g. information security policy, cryptographic control policy). The operational requirements of new systems shall be established, documented and tested prior to their acceptance and use. As regards network security, appropriate controls, including segmentation and secure management, should be implemented based on the criticality of data flows and the level of risk of the network zones in the organisation. There shall be specific controls to protect sensitive information passing over public networks. Access to system files and program source code shall be controlled and IT projects and support activities conducted in a secure manner. Care shall be taken to avoid exposure of sensitive data in test environments. Project and support environments shall be strictly controlled. Deployment of changes in production shall be strictly controlled. A risk assessment of the major changes to be deployed in production shall be conducted. Regular security testing activities of systems in production shall also be conducted according to a predefined plan based on the outcome of a risk-assessment, and security testing shall include, at least, vulnerability assessments. All of the shortcomings highlighted during the security testing activities shall be assessed and action plans to close any identified gap shall be prepared and followed-up in a timely fashion. Requirement 1.11: Information security in supplier ( 3 ) relationships To ensure protection of the participant’s internal information systems that are accessible by suppliers, information security requirements for mitigating the risks associated with supplier’s access shall be documented and formally agreed upon with the supplier. Requirement 1.12: Management of information security incidents and improvements To ensure a consistent and effective approach to the management of information security incidents, including communication on security events and weaknesses, roles, responsibilities and procedures, at business and technical level, shall be established and tested to ensure a quick, effective and orderly and safely recover from information security incidents including scenarios related to a cyberrelated cause (e.g. a fraud pursued by an external attacker or by an insider). Personnel involved in these procedures shall be adequately trained. Requirement 1.13: Technical compliance review A participant’s internal information systems (e.g. back office systems, internal networks and external network connectivity) shall be regularly assessed for compliance with the organisation’s established framework of policies (e.g. information security policy, cryptographic control policy). Requirement 1.14: Virtualisation Guest virtual machines shall comply with all the security controls that are set for physical hardware and systems (e.g. hardening, logging). Controls relating to hypervisors must include: hardening of the hypervisor and the hosting operating system, regular patching, strict separation of different environments (e.g. production and development). Centralised management, logging and monitoring as well as managing of access rights, in particular for high privileged accounts, shall be implemented based on a risk assessment. Guest virtual machines managed by the same hypervisor shall have a similar risk profile. Requirement 1.15: Cloud computing The usage of public and/or hybrid cloud solutions in the Payment Transaction Chain must be based on a formal risk assessment, taking into account the technical controls and the contractual clauses related to the cloud solution. If hybrid cloud solutions are used, it is understood that the criticality level of the overall system is the highest one of the connected systems. All on-premises components of the hybrid solutions must be segregated from the other on-premises systems. 2. Business Continuity Management The following requirements relate to business continuity management. Each TARGET participant designated by the Eurosystem as being critical for the smooth functioning of the TARGET system shall have a business continuity strategy in place that complies with the following requirements. Requirement 2.1: Business continuity plans shall be developed and procedures for maintaining them are in place. Requirement 2.2: An alternate operational site shall be available. Requirement 2.3: The risk profile of the alternate site shall be different from that of the primary site, in order to avoid that both sites are affected by the same event at the same time. For example, the alternate site shall be on a different power grid and central telecommunication circuit from those of the primary business location. Requirement 2.4: In the event of a major operational disruption rendering the primary site inaccessible and/or critical staff unavailable, the critical participant shall be able to resume normal operations from the alternate site, where it shall be possible to properly close the business day and open the following business day(s). Requirement 2.5: Procedures shall be in place to ensure that the processing of transactions is resumed from the alternate site within a reasonable timeframe after the initial disruption of service and commensurate to the criticality of the business that was disrupted. Requirement 2.6: The ability to cope with operational disruptions shall be tested at least once a year and critical staff shall be aptly trained. The maximum period between tests shall not exceed one year. ( 1 ) The need-to-know principle refers to the identification of the set of information that an individual needs access to in order to carry out her/his duties. ( 2 ) The principle of least privilege refers to the tailoring a subject’s access profile to an IT system to match the corresponding business role. ( 3 ) A supplier in the context of this exercise should be understood as any third party (and its personnel) which is under contract (agreement), with the institution, to provide a service and under the service agreement the third party (and its personnel) is granted access, either remotely or on site, to information and/or information systems and/or information processing facilities of the institution in scope or associated to the scope covered under the exercise of the TARGET self-certification.

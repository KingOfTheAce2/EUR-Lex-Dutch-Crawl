(2) The Union remains unwavering in its support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. (3) In its conclusions of 24 and 25 June 2021, the European Council called on Russia to fully assume its responsibility in ensuring the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements as the key condition for any substantial change in the Union’s stance. It stressed the need for a firm and coordinated response by the Union and its Member States to any further malign, illegal and disruptive activity by Russia, making full use of all instruments at the Union’s disposal, and ensuring coordination with partners. To that end, the European Council also invited the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (the ‘High Representative’) to present options for additional restrictive measures, including economic sanctions. (4) In its conclusions of 16 December 2021, the European Council stressed the urgent need for Russia to de-escalate tensions caused by the military build-up along its border with Ukraine and aggressive rhetoric. It reiterated its full support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. While encouraging diplomatic efforts and supporting the Normandy format in achieving the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements, the European Council stated that any further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost in response, including restrictive measures coordinated with partners. (5) On 24 January 2022, the Council approved conclusions in which it condemned Russia’s continued aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine, and called on Russia to de-escalate, to abide by international law and to engage constructively in dialogue through the established international mechanisms. The Council reaffirmed the Union’s full commitment to the core principles on which European security is built, enshrined in the United Nations (UN) Charter and the founding documents of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, including the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris. These core principles include in particular the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States, the inviolability of frontiers, refraining from the threat or use of force, and the freedom of States to choose or change their own security arrangements. The Council stated that those principles are neither negotiable nor subject to revision or re-interpretation and that their violation by Russia is an obstacle to a common and indivisible security space in Europe and threatens peace and stability on the European continent. Recalling the European Council conclusions of December 2021, the Council reiterated that any further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe costs, including a wide array of sectoral and individual restrictive measures that would be adopted in coordination with partners. (6) On 19 February 2022, the High Representative issued a declaration on behalf of the Union expressing concern over the massive build-up of Russian armed forces in and around Ukraine and urged Russia to engage in meaningful dialogue and diplomacy, show restraint and de-escalate by a substantial withdrawal of military forces from the proximity of Ukraine’s borders. The Union stated that any further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe costs in response, including restrictive measures coordinated with partners. (7) On 21 February 2022, the President of the Russian Federation signed a decree recognising the independence and sovereignty of the self-proclaimed ‘Donetsk People's Republic’ and the ‘Luhansk People's Republic’ and ordered Russian armed forces to be deployed in Eastern Ukraine. (8) On 22 February 2022, the High Representative issued a declaration on behalf of the Union condemning the decision of the President of the Russian Federation to recognise the non-government controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine as independent entities and the ensuing decision to send Russian troops into those areas. That illegal act further undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and independence and is a severe breach of international law and international agreements, including the UN Charter, Helsinki Final Act, Paris Charter and Budapest Memorandum, as well as of the Minsk Agreements and UN Security Council Resolution 2202 (2015). The High Representative urged Russia, as a party to the conflict, to reverse that recognition, uphold its commitments, abide by international law and return to the discussions within the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group. He announced that the Union would respond to these latest violations by Russia by adopting additional restrictive measures as a matter of urgency. (9) In view of the gravity of the situation, the Council considers that 22 persons and four entities should be added to the list of persons, entities and bodies subject to restrictive measures set out in the Annex to Decision 2014/145/CFSP. (10) The Council considers that a derogation mechanism for certain operations applicable to certain entities listed in the Annex to Decision 2014/145/CFSP should be added. (11) Decision 2014/145/CFSP should therefore be amended accordingly, HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: Article 1 Decision 2014/145/CFSP is amended as follows: (1) in Article 2, the following paragraph is added: ‘8.   By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 and 2, the competent authorities of a Member State may authorise the release of certain frozen funds or economic resources belonging to the entities listed under entry numbers 53, 54 and 55 in the Annex, or the making available of certain funds or economic resources to those entities, under such conditions as the competent authorities deem appropriate and after having determined that such funds or economic resources are necessary for the termination by 24 August 2022 of operations, contracts or other agreements, including correspondent banking relations, concluded with those entities before 23 February 2022.’; (2) the persons and entities listed in the Annex to this Decision shall be added to the list set out in the Annex to Decision 2014/145/CFSP.

( 2 ) Gedelegeerde Verordening (EU, Euratom) 2015/2401 van de Commissie van 2 oktober 2015 betreffende de inhoud en de werking van het register van Europese politieke partijen en Europese politieke stichtingen ( PB L 333 van 19.12.2015, blz. 50 ). BIJLAGE STATUTES FOR THE ALLIANCE FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM (A NON-PROFIT ASSOCIATION under Belgian Law) I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES Article 1 The Association, a European political party, is to be known as the ‘Alliance for Peace and Freedom’ (APF), hereinafter referred to as ‘the APF’ or ‘the Association’. This name shall always be preceded or followed by, or treated as if followed by, the words ‘non-profit–organisation under Belgian Law’. The Association is governed by the provisions of the laws of the EU on European political parties and the laws in Belgium on non-profit associations. Article 2 The seat of the association is established in Belgium, 22 square de Meeus, 1050 Brussels. It may, by decision of the Executive, move its seat to any other address in Belgium. The logo of the association consists of the three letters ‘APF’ in red, together with an image of a lady (‘Europe’) riding a bull: [This logo can be altered by the Executive] Article 3 The Association pursues political objectives, as laid down in this political programme: We stand for a Europe of sovereign nations in which the independent states work together on a confederated basis to address the great challenges of our time and to protect, celebrate and promote our common Christian values and European cultural heritage. We seek to address the democratic deficit within the existing structures of the EU by providing an effective voice for the large numbers of citizens, particularly young people, at present alienated from the democratic process. We stand for a revival of popular involvement in decision-making and for the elimination of corruption and the influence of money and the corporate media from our political institutions. We aim to help families, law-abiding citizens, young people and unemployed often treated as second class citizens with the voices and organisational lead they need to assert their rights. Staunch supporters of the fundamental human right to a peaceful life with a decent standard of living in one’s own homeland, we are opposed to mass immigration which often results in discrimination and inequality – afflicting both immigrants and indigenous citizens — within the host nations. We are committed to providing the leadership and education required by the Youth of Europe to resist the destruction of our traditional values and consequently of peoples and cultures. We cherish the rich diversity which forms a tapestry of human belonging both within Europe and beyond and which is under threat from the homogenising tendencies of a world shrunk by technology and globalism. We therefore seek a constructive path between the twin evils of negative racism and rootless consumerism, and to develop ways to protect and celebrate the diversity which provides the foundation stone of human identity. Recognising that our diverse nations are each an extended family, we stand for the right and primary duty of each national government to act as a father to its nation and in particular to defend the people and their common wealth and heritage from the injustices and exploitation caused by the ‘logic’ of the market and the corruption of politicians and elites. We stand in particular for Peace and to expose and oppose the attempts to jeopardize peace and create unnecessary hostility towards the eastern half of European civilisation. While we recognise that there are a number of unresolved historical disputes between various European nations, we are determined that these should be resolved through negotiation and compromise, rather than being exploited by external forces at the risk of increasing tensions and even war. In the ethical sphere, which stands above and sets the boundaries of our politics and policies, we seek to instill in to our peoples and our youth a respect for life from beginning to end and a new spirit of honesty, self-sacrifice and an ethos of service. The APF observes: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. The APF does not pursue profit goals. The APF is committed to providing equal opportunity for individuals of both sexes within its organisation on the grounds of merit and rejects all forms of discrimination, particularly discrimination based on gender. Article 4 The object of the Association is to: — promote and foster a close and constant cooperation between its members for the purpose of advancing at European level the common Principles set out above; — promote and organize joint actions of its members at European level; — work in favour of genuine free and pluralistic democracy; — encourage respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms including in particular freedom of speech and association, and the rule of law; — promote respect for the indivisible right to freedom of expression and other fundamental rights of man and of the citizen as the foundation of the values that should be upheld within and by the European Union — participate in the next elections to the European Parliament. In order to achieve these objectives and to establish, develop, implement and promote its policy objectives, the APF exists to organise discussions forums, educational events and events and outreach initiatives according to democratic principles, and to publish material in various forms including printed matter, video and internet formats in order to increase public awareness of our work and the issues which it addresses. The Association and her representatives are authorised to take such actions as are directly or indirectly useful or necessary for the promotion and achievement of the above objectives. Through their acts, parties that are or become members of the Association will support the positions taken by the Association in the framework of the European Union. In the context of their national responsibilities, they will maintain their own name, their identity and their freedom of action. Article 5 The Association is incorporated for an indefinite period.

ETN is organised as a separate legal entity with separate financial accounts, operating in accordance with its own statutes and internal regulations. Article 15 Accounts The Association fiscal year runs from 1 January to 31 December.

Article 18 The President represents the association legally. The Treasurer represents the association financially. The General Secretary represents the association administratively. They have the power to represent the association in every Member State of the European Union, and in the rest of the world. Article 19 The Association will respect all laws concerning transparency, in particular in relation to bookkeeping, accounts and donations, privacy and the protection of personal data. The Executive will receive all requests concerning these issues, study them and decide the appropriate reaction. The Association has members who have been, and are at present, the victim of hate campaigns, intimidation, vandalism, violence, and even terrorist attacks. The Association will therefore carefully balance the value of transparency with the value of privacy, safety and security of its Members, and the Executive has the most complete competence to defend the interests of the Association and its Members.

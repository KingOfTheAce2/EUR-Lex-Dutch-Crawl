However, if the test was performed at a higher impact speed and the vehicle met the requirements, the test shall be considered satisfactory. 5.   MEASUREMENTS TO BE MADE ON DUMMY IN FRONT SEATS 5.1.   All the measurements necessary for the verification of the performance criteria shall be made with measurement systems corresponding to the specifications of Annex 8. The different parameters shall be recorded through independent data channels of the following CFC (Channel Frequency Class). 5.2.1.   Measurements in the head of the dummy The acceleration (a) referring to the centre of gravity is calculated from the triaxial components of the acceleration measured with a CFC of 1 000. 5.2.2.   Measurements in the neck of the dummy 5.2.2.1.   The axial tensile force and the fore/aft shear force at the neck/head interface are measured with a CFC of 1 000. 5.2.2.2.   The bending moment about a lateral axis at the neck/head interface are measured with a CFC of 600. 5.2.3.   Measurements in the thorax of the dummy The chest deflection between the sternum and the spine is measured with a CFC of 180. 5.2.4.   Measurements in the femur and tibia of the dummy 5.2.4.1.   The axial compressive force and the bending moments are measured with a CFC of 600. 5.2.4.2.   The displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur is measured at the knee sliding joint with a CFC of 180. 6.   MEASUREMENTS TO BE MADE ON THE VEHICLE 6.1.   To enable the simplified test described in Annex 7 to be carried out, the deceleration time history of the structure shall be determined on the basis of the value of the longitudinal accelerometers at the base of the ‘B’ pillar on the struck side of the vehicle with a CFC of 180 by means of data channels corresponding to the requirements set out in Annex 8; 6.2.   The speed time history which will be used in the test procedure described in Annex 7 shall be obtained from the longitudinal accelerometer at the ‘B’ pillar on the struck side. ANNEX 4 Determination of performance criteria 1.   HEAD PERFORMANCE CRITERION (HPC) 1.1.   This criterion is considered to be satisfied when, during the test, there is no contact between the head and any vehicle component. If that is not the case, a calculation of the value of HPC is made, on the basis of the acceleration (a), measured according to paragraph 5.2.1 of Annex 3, by the following expression: in which: 1.2.1.   the term ‘a’ is the resultant acceleration measured according to paragraph 5.2.1. of Annex 3 and is measured in units of gravity, g (1 g = 9,81 m/s 2 ); 1.2.2.   if the beginning of the head contact can be determined satisfactorily, t 1 and t 2 are the two time instants, expressed in seconds, defining an interval between the beginning of the head contact and the end of the recording for which the value of HPC is maximum; 1.2.3.   if the beginning of the head contact cannot be determined, t 1 and t 2 are the two time instants, expressed in seconds, defining a time interval between the beginning and the end of the recording for which the value of HPC is maximum; 1.2.4.   Values of HPC for which the time interval (t 1 - t 2 ) is greater than 36 ms are ignored for the purposes of calculating the maximum value. 1.3.   The value of the resultant head acceleration during forward impact which is exceeded for 3 ms cumulatively is calculated from the resultant head acceleration measured according to paragraph 5.2.1 of Annex 3. 2.   NECK INJURY CRITERIA (NIC) 2.1.   These criteria are determined by the compressive axial force, the axial tensile force and the fore/aft shear forces at the head/neck interface, expressed in kN and measured according to paragraph 5.2.2 of Annex 3 and by the duration of these forces expressed in ms. 2.2.   The neck bending moment criterion is determined by the bending moment, expressed in Nm, about a lateral axis at the head/neck interface and measured according to paragraph 5.2.2 of Annex 3. 2.3.   The neck flexion bending moment, expressed in Nm, shall be recorded. 3.   THORAX COMPRESSION CRITERION (ThCC) AND VISCOUS CRITERION (V * C) 3.1.   The thorax compression criterion is determined by the absolute value of the thorax deformation, expressed in mm and measured according to paragraph 5.2.3 of Annex 3. 3.2.   The viscous criterion (V * C) is calculated as the instantaneous product of the compression and the rate of deflection of the sternum, measured according to paragraph 6 and also paragraph 5.2.3 of Annex 3. 4.   FEMUR FORCE CRITERION (FFC) 4.1.   This criterion is determined by the compression load expressed in kN, transmitted axially on each femur of the dummy and measured according to paragraph 5.2.4 of Annex 3 and by the duration of the compressive load expressed in ms. 5.   TIBIA COMPRESSIVE FORCE CRITERION (TCFC) AND TIBIA INDEX (TI) 5.1.   The tibia compressive force criterion is determined by the compressive load (F z ) expressed in kN, transmitted axially on each tibia of the dummy and measured according to paragraph 5.2.4 of Annex 3. 5.2.   The tibia index is calculated on the basis of the bending moments (Mx and My) measured according to paragraph 5.1 by the following expression: where: M x = bending moment about the x axis M y = bending moment about the y axis (M c ) R = critical bending moment and shall be taken to be 225 Nm F z = compressive axial force in the z direction (F c ) z = critical compressive force in the z direction and shall be taken to be 35,9 kN and M R = . The tibia index is calculated for the top and the bottom of each tibia; however, F z may be measured at either location. The value obtained is used for the top and bottom TI calculations. Moments Mx and My are both measured separately at both locations. 6.   PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE VISCOUS CRITERIA (V * C) FOR HYBRID III DUMMY 6.1.   The viscous criterion is calculated as the instantaneous product of the compression and the rate of deflection of the sternum. Both are derived from the measurement of sternum deflection. 6.2.   The sternum deflection response is filtered once at CFC 180. The compression at time t is calculated from this filtered signal as: The sternum deflection velocity at time t is calculated from the filtered deflection as: where D( t ) is the deflection at time t in metres and ∂t is the time interval in seconds between the measurements of deflection. The maximum value of ∂t shall be 1,25 x 10 -4 seconds. This calculation procedure is shown diagrammatically below: ANNEX 5 Arrangement and installation of dummies and adjustment of restraint systems 1.   ARRANGEMENT OF DUMMIES 1.1.   Separate seats The plane of symmetry of the dummy shall coincide with the vertical median plane of the seat. 1.2.   Front bench seat 1.2.1.   Driver The plane of symmetry of the dummy shall lie in the vertical plane passing through the steering wheel centre and parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle.

Remove all slack from the lap belt. Pull the upper torso webbing out of the retractor and allow it to retract. Repeat this operation four times. Apply a 9 to 18 N tension load to the lap belt. If the belt system is equipped with a tension-relieving device, introduce the maximum amount of slack into the upper torso belt that is recommended by the manufacturer for normal use in the owner’s manual for the vehicle. If the belt system is not equipped with a tension-relieving device, allow the excess webbing in the shoulder belt to be retracted by the retractive force of the retractor. ANNEX 6 Procedure for determining the ‘H’ point and the actual torso angle for seating positions in motor vehicles 1.   PURPOSE The procedure described in this Annex is used to establish the ‘H’ point location and the actual torso angle for one or several seating positions in a motor vehicle and to verify the relationship of measured data to design specifications given by the vehicle manufacturer ( 6 ) . 2.   DEFINITIONS For the purposes of this Annex: ‘reference data’ means one or several of the following characteristics of a seating position: 2.1.1.   the ‘H’ point and the ‘R’ point and their relationship; 2.1.2.   the actual torso angle and the design torso angle and their relationship; 2.2.   ‘three-dimensional “H” point machine’ (3-D H machine) means the device used for the determination of ‘H’ points and actual torso angles. This device is described in Appendix 1 to this Annex; 2.3.   ‘“H” point’ means the pivot centre of the torso and the thigh of the 3-D H machine installed in the vehicle seat in accordance with paragraph 4. The ‘H’ point is located in the centre of the centreline of the device which is between the ‘H’ point sight buttons on either side of the 3-D H machine. The ‘H’ point corresponds theoretically to the ‘R’ point (for tolerances see paragraph 3.2.2). Once determined in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph 4, the ‘H’ point is considered fixed in relation to the seat-cushion structure and to move with it when the seat is adjusted; 2.4.   ‘“R” point’ or ‘seating reference point’ means a design point defined by the vehicle manufacturer for each seating position and established with respect to the three-dimensional reference system; 2.5.   ‘torso-line’ means the centreline of the probe of the 3-D H machine with the probe in the fully rearward position; 2.6.   ‘actual torso angle’ means the angle measured between a vertical line through the ‘H’ point and the torso line using the back angle quadrant on the 3-D H machine. The actual torso angle corresponds theoretically to the design torso angle (for tolerances see paragraph 3.2.2): 2.7.   ‘design torso angle’ means the angle measures between a vertical line through the ‘R’ point and the torso line in a position which corresponds to the design position of the seat-back established by the vehicle manufacturer; 2.8.   ‘centreplane of occupant’ (C/LO) means the median plane of the 3-D H machine positioned in each designated seating position; it is represented by the coordinate of the ‘H’ point on the ‘Y’ axis. For individual seats, the centreplane of the seat coincides with the centreplane of the occupant. For other seats, the centreplane of the occupant is specified by the manufacturer; 2.9.   ‘three-dimensional reference system’ means a system as described in Appendix 2 to this Annex; 2.10.   ‘fiducial marks’ are physical points (holes, surfaces, marks or indentations) on the vehicle body as defined by the manufacturer; 2.11.   ‘vehicle measuring attitude’ means the position of the vehicle as defined by the coordinates of fiducial marks in the three-dimensional reference system. 3.   REQUIREMENTS 3.1.   Data presentation For each seating position where reference data are required in order to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of the present Regulation, all or an appropriate selection of the following data shall be presented in the form indicated in Appendix 3 to this Annex: 3.1.1.   the coordinates of the ‘R’ point relative to the three-dimensional reference system; 3.1.2.   the design torso angle; 3.1.3.   all indications necessary to adjust the seat (if it is adjustable) to the measuring position set out in paragraph 4.3. 3.2.   Relationship between measured data and design specifications 3.2.1.   The coordinates of the ‘H’ point and the value of the actual torso angle obtained by the procedure set out in paragraph 4 shall be compared, respectively, with the coordinates of the ‘R’ point and the value of the design torso angle indicated by the vehicle manufacturer. 3.2.2.   The relative positions of the ‘R’ point and the ‘H’ point and the relationship between the design torso angle and the actual torso angle shall be considered satisfactory for the seating position in question if the ‘H’ point, as defined by its coordinates, lies within a square of 50 mm side length with horizontal and vertical sides whose diagonals intersect at the ‘R’ point, and if the actual torso angle is within 5° of the design torso angle. 3.2.3.   If these conditions are met, the ‘R’ point and the design torso angle, shall be used to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. 3.2.4.   If the ‘H’ point or the actual torso angle does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 3.2.2, the ‘H’ point and the actual torso angle shall be determined twice more (three times in all). If the results of two of these three operations satisfy the requirements, the conditions of paragraph 3.2.3 shall apply. 3.2.5.   If the results of at least two of the three operations described in paragraph 3.2.4 do not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 3.2.2, or if the verification cannot take place because the vehicle manufacturer has failed to supply information regarding the position of the ‘R’ point or regarding the design torso angle, the centroid of the three measured points or the average of the three measured angles shall be used and be regarded as applicable in all cases where the ‘R’ point or the design torso angle is referred to in this Regulation. 4.   PROCEDURE FOR ‘H’ POINT AND ACTUAL TORSO ANGLE DETERMINATION 4.1.   The vehicle shall be preconditioned at the manufacturer’s discretion, at a temperature of 20 ± 10 °C to ensure that the seat material reached room temperature. If the seat to be checked has never been sat upon, a 70 to 80 kg person or device shall sit on the seat twice for one minute to flex the cushion and back. At the manufacturer’s request, all seat assemblies shall remain unloaded for a minimum period of 30 min prior to installation of the 3-D H machine. 4.2.   The vehicle shall be at the measuring attitude defined in paragraph 2.11. 4.3.   The seat, if it is adjustable, shall be adjusted first to the rearmost normal driving or riding position, as indicated by the vehicle manufacturer, taking into consideration only the longitudinal adjustment of the seat, excluding seat travel used for purposes other than normal driving or riding positions. Where other modes of seat adjustment exist (vertical, angular, seat-back, etc.) these will then be adjusted to the position specified by the vehicle manufacturer. For suspension seats, the vertical position shall be rigidly fixed corresponding to a normal driving position as specified by the manufacturer. 4.4.   The area of the seating position contacted by the 3-D H machine shall be covered by a muslin cotton, of sufficient size and appropriate texture, described as a plain cotton fabric having 18,9 threads per cm2 and weighing 0,228 kg/m2 or knitted or non-woven fabric having equivalent characteristics. If the test is run on a seat outside the vehicle, the floor on which the seat is placed shall have the same essential characteristics ( 7 ) as the floor of the vehicle in which the seat is intended to be used. 4.5.   Place the seat and back assembly of the 3-D H machine so that the centreplane of the occupant (C/LO) coincides with the centreplane of the 3-D H machine. At the manufacturer’s request, the 3-D H machine may be moved inboard with respect to the C/LO if the 3-D H machine is located so far outboard that the seat edge will not permit levelling of the 3-D H machine. 4.6.   Attach the foot and lower leg assemblies to the seat pan assembly, either individually or by using the T-bar and lower leg assembly. A line through the ‘H’ point sight buttons shall be parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the longitudinal centreplane of the seat. Adjust the feet and leg positions of the 3-D H machine as follows: designated seating position: driver and outside front passenger: 4.7.1.1.   both feet and leg assemblies shall be moved forward in such a way that the feet take up natural positions on the floor, between the operating pedals if necessary. Where possible the left foot shall be located approximately the same distance to the left of the centreplane of the 3-D H machine as the right foot is to the right. The spirit level verifying the transverse orientation of the 3-D H machine is brought to the horizontal by readjustment of the seat pan if necessary, or by adjusting the leg and foot assemblies towards the rear. The line passing through the ‘H’ point sight buttons shall be maintained perpendicular to the longitudinal centreplane of the seat; 4.7.1.2.   if the left leg cannot be kept parallel to the right leg and the left foot cannot be supported by the structure, move the left foot until it is supported. The alignment of the sight buttons shall be maintained; 4.7.2.   designated seating position: outboard rear: for rear seats or auxiliary seats, the legs are located as specified by the manufacturer. If the feet then rest on parts of the floor which are at different levels, the foot which first comes into contact with the front seat shall serve as a reference and the other foot shall be so arranged that the spirit level giving the transverse orientation of the seat of the device indicates the horizontal; 4.7.3.   other designated seating positions: the general procedure indicated in paragraph 4.7.1 shall be followed except that the feet shall be placed as specified by the vehicle manufacturer. 4.8.   Apply lower leg and thigh weights and level the 3-D H machine. Tilt the back pan forward against the forward stop and draw the 3-D H machine away from the seat-back using the T-bar. Reposition the 3-D H machine on the seat by one of the following methods: 4.9.1.   if the 3-D H machine tends to slide rearward, use the following procedure. Allow the 3-D H machine to slide rearward until a forward horizontal restraining load on the T-bar is no longer required, i.e. until the seat pan contacts the seat-back. If necessary, reposition the lower leg; 4.9.2.   if the 3-D H machine does not tend to slide rearward, use the following procedure. Slide the 3-D H machine rearwards by applying a horizontal rearward load to the T-bar until the seat pan contacts the seat-back (see Figure 2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex). 4.10.   Apply a 100 ± 10 N load to the back and pan assembly of the 3-D H machine at the intersection of the hip angle quadrant and the T-bar housing. The direction of load application shall be maintained along a line passing by the above intersection to a point just above the thigh bar housing (see Figure 2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex). Then carefully return the back pan to the seat-back. Care must be exercised throughout the remainder of the procedure to prevent the 3-D H machine from sliding forward. 4.11.   Install the right and left buttock weights and then, alternately, the eight torso weights. Maintain the 3-D H machine level. 4.12.   Tilt the back pan forward to release the tension on the seat-back. Rock the 3-D H machine from side to side through a 10° arc (5° to each side of the vertical centreplane) for three complete cycles to release any accumulated friction between the 3-D H machine and the seat. During the rocking action, the T-bar of the 3-D H machine may tend to diverge from the specified horizontal and vertical alignment. The T-bar must therefore be restrained by applying an appropriate lateral load during the rocking motions. Care shall be exercised in holding the T-bar and rocking the 3-D H machine to ensure that no inadvertent exterior loads are applied in a vertical or fore and aft direction. The feet of the 3-D H machine are not to be restrained or held during this step. If the feet change position, they should be allowed to remain in that attitude for the moment. Carefully return the back pan to the seat-back and check the two spirit levels for zero position. If any movement of the feet has occurred during the rocking operation of the 3-D H machine, they must be repositioned as follows: alternately, lift each foot off the floor the minimum necessary amount until no additional foot movement is obtained. During this lifting, the feet are to be free to rotate; and no forward or lateral loads are to be applied. When each foot is placed back in the down position, the heel is to be in contact with the structure designed for this; check the lateral spirit level for zero position; if necessary, apply a lateral load to the top of the back pan sufficient to level the 3-D H machine’s seat pan on the seat. 4.13.   Holding the T-bar to prevent the 3-D H machine from sliding forward on the seat cushion, proceed as follows: (a) return the back pan to the seat-back; (b) alternately apply and release a horizontal rearward load, not to exceed 25 N, to the back angle bar at a height approximately at the centre of the torso weights until the hip angle quadrant indicates that a stable position has been reached after load release. Care shall be exercised to ensure that no exterior downward or lateral loads are applied to the 3-D H machine. If another level adjustment of the 3-D H machine is necessary, rotate the back pan forward, re-level, and repeat the procedure from paragraph 4.12. Take all measurements: 4.14.1.   the coordinates of the ‘H’ point are measured with respect to the three-dimensional reference system. 4.14.2.   the actual torso angle is read at the back angle quadrant of the 3-D H machine with the probe in its fully rearward position. 4.15.   If a re-run of the installation of the 3-D H machine is desired, the seat assembly should remain unloaded for a minimum period of 30 min prior to the re-run. The 3-D H machine should not be left loaded on the seat assembly longer than the time required to perform the test. If the seats in the same row can be regarded as similar (bench seat, identical seats, etc.) only one ‘H’ point and one ‘actual torso angle’ shall be determined for each row of seats, the 3-D H machine described in Appendix 1 to this Annex being seated in a place regarded as representative for the row. This place shall be: 4.16.1.   in the case of the front row, the driver’s seat; 4.16.2.   in the case of the rear row or rows, an outer seat. Appendix 1 Description of the three-dimensional ‘H’ point machine ( 8 ) (3-D H machine) 1.   BACK AND SEAT PANS The back and seat pans are constructed of reinforced plastic and metal; they simulate the human torso and thigh and are mechanically hinged at the ‘H’ point. A quadrant is fastened to the probe hinged at the ‘H’ point to measure the actual torso angle. An adjustable thigh bar, attached to the seat pan, establishes the thigh centreline and serves as a baseline for the hip angle quadrant. 2.   BODY AND LEG ELEMENTS Lower leg segments are connected to the seat pan assembly at the T-bar joining the knees, which is a lateral extension of the adjustable thigh bar. Quadrants are incorporated in the lower leg segments to measure knee angles. Shoe and foot assemblies are calibrated to measure the foot angle. Two spirit levels orient the device in space. Body element weights are placed at the corresponding centres of gravity to provide seat penetration equivalent to a 76 kg male. All joints of the 3-D H machine should be checked for free movement without encountering noticeable friction. Appendix 2 Three-dimensional reference system 1.   The three-dimensional reference system is defined by three orthogonal planes established by the vehicle manufacturer (see Figure) ( 9 ) . 2.   The vehicle measuring attitude is established by positioning the vehicle on the supporting surface such that the coordinates of the fiducial marks correspond to the values indicated by the manufacturer. 3.   The coordinates of the ‘R’ point and the ‘H’ point are established in relation to the fiducial marks defined by the vehicle manufacturer. Appendix 3 Reference data concerning seat positions 1.   Coding of reference data Reference data are listed consecutively for each seating position. Seating positions are identified by a two-digit code. The first digit is an Arabic numeral and designates the row of seats, counting from the front to the rear of the vehicle.

It shall be so guided that, during the impact phase, the deviation in the vertical plane does not exceed 5° and 2° in the horizontal plane. 1.2.   State of the structure 1.2.1.   General The structure tested shall be representative of the series production of the vehicles concerned. Some components may be replaced or removed where such replacement or removal clearly has no effect on the test results. 1.2.2.   Adjustments Adjustments shall conform to those set out in paragraph 1.4.3 of Annex 3 to this Regulation, taking into account what is stated in paragraph 1.2.1. 1.3.   Attachment of the structure 1.3.1.   The structure shall be firmly attached to the trolley in such a way that no relative displacement occurs during the test. 1.3.2.   The method used to fasten the structure to the trolley shall not have the effect of strengthening the seat anchorages or restraint devices, or of producing any abnormal deformation of the structure. 1.3.3.   The attachment device recommended is that whereby the structure rests on supports placed approximately in the axis of the wheels or, if possible, whereby the structure is secured to the trolley by the fastenings of the suspension system. 1.3.4.   The angle between the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and the direction of motion of the trolley shall be 0° ± 2°. 1.4   Dummies The dummies and their positioning shall conform to the specifications in Annex 3, paragraph 2. 1.5.   Measuring apparatus 1.5.1.   Deceleration of the structure The position of the transducers measuring the deceleration of the structure during the impact shall be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the trolley according to the specifications of Annex 8 (CFC 180). 1.5.2.   Measurements to be made on the dummies All the measurements necessary for checking the listed criteria are set out in Annex 3, paragraph 5. 1.6.   Deceleration curve of the structure The deceleration curve of the structure during the impact phase shall be such that the ‘variation of speed in relation to time’ curve obtained by integration at no point differs by more than ± 1 m/s from the ‘variation of speed in relation to time’ reference curve of the vehicle concerned as defined in the Appendix to this Annex. A displacement with regard to the time axis of the reference curve may be used to obtain the structure velocity inside the corridor. 1.7.   Reference curve V = f(t) of the vehicle concerned This reference curve is obtained by integration of the deceleration curve of the vehicle concerned measured in the frontal collision test against a barrier as provided for in paragraph 6 of Annex 3 to this Regulation. 1.8.   Equivalent method The test may be performed by some other method than that of deceleration of a trolley, provided that such method complies with the requirement concerning the range of variation of speed described in paragraph 1.6. Appendix Equivalence curve – tolerance band for curve ΔV = f(t) ANNEX 8 Technique of measurement in measurement tests: instrumentation 1.   DEFINITIONS 1.1.   Data channel A data channel comprises all the instrumentation from a transducer (or multiple transducers whose outputs are combined in some specified way) up to and including any analysis procedures that may alter the frequency content or the amplitude content of data. 1.2.   Transducer The first device in a data channel used to convert a physical quantity to be measured into a second quantity (such as an electrical voltage) which can be processed by the remainder of the channel. 1.3.   Channel amplitude class: CAC The designation for a data channel that meets certain amplitude characteristics as specified in this Annex. The CAC number is numerically equal to the upper limit of the measurement range. 1.4.   Characteristic frequencies F H , F L , F N These frequencies are defined in Figure 1. 1.5.   Channels frequency class: CFC The channel frequency class is designated by a number indicating that the channel frequency response lies within the limits specified in Figure 1. This number and the value of the frequency F H in Hz are numerically equal. 1.6.   Sensitivity coefficient The slope of the straight line representing the best fit to the calibration values determined by the method of least square within the channel amplitude class. 1.7.   Calibration factor of a data channel The mean value of the sensitivity coefficients evaluated over frequencies which are evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale between F L and F H /2.5 1.8.   Linearity error The ratio, in %, of the maximum difference between the calibration value and the corresponding value read on the straight line defined in paragraph 1.6 at the upper limit of the channel amplitude class. 1.9.   Cross sensitivity The ratio of the output signal to the input signal, when an excitation is applied to the transducer perpendicular to the measurement axis. It is expressed as a percentage of the sensitivity along the measurement axis. 1.10.   Phase delay time The phase delay time of a data channel is equal to the phase delay (in radians) of a sinusoidal signal, divided by the angular frequency of that signal (in radians/second). 1.11.   Environment The aggregate, at a given moment, of all external conditions and influences to which the data channel is subjected. 2.   PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS 2.1.   Linearity error The absolute value of the linearity error of a data channel at any frequency in the CFC, shall be equal to or less than 2.5 % of the value of the CAC, over the whole measurement range. 2.2.   Amplitude against frequency The frequency response of a data channel shall lie within the limiting curves given in Figure 1. The zero dB line is determined by the calibration factor. 2.3.   Phase delay time The phase delay time between the input and the output signals of a data channel shall be determined and shall not vary by more than 1/10 F H seconds between 0,03 F H and F H . 2.4.   Time 2.4.1.   Time base A time base shall be recorded and shall at least give 1/100 s with an accuracy of 1 %. 2.4.2.   Relative time delay The relative time delay between the signal of two or more data channels, regardless of their frequency class, must not exceed 1 ms excluding delay caused by phase shift. Two or more data channels of which the signals are combined shall have the same frequency class and shall not have relative time delay greater than 1/10 F H seconds. This requirement applies to analogue signals as well as to synchronisation pulses and digital signals. 2.5.   Transducer cross sensitivity The transducer cross sensitivity shall be less than 5 % in any direction. 2.6.   Calibration 2.6.1.   General A data channel shall be calibrated at least once a year against reference equipment traceable to known standards. The methods used to carry out a comparison with reference equipment shall not introduce an error greater than 1 % of the CAC. The use of the reference equipment is limited to the frequency range for which they have been calibrated. Subsystems of a data channel may be evaluated individually and the results factored into the accuracy of the total data channel. This can be done for example by an electrical signal of known amplitude simulating the output signal of the transducer which allows a check to be made on the gain factor of the data channel, excluding the transducer. 2.6.2.   Accuracy of reference equipment for calibration The accuracy of the reference equipment shall be certified or endorsed by an official metrology service. 2.6.2.1.   Static calibration 2.6.2.1.1.   Accelerations The errors shall be less than ± 1,5 % of the channel amplitude class. 2.6.2.1.2.   Forces The error shall be less than ± 1 % of the channel amplitude class. 2.6.2.1.3.   Displacements The error shall be less than ± 1 % of the channel amplitude class. 2.6.2.2.   Dynamic calibration 2.6.2.2.1.   Accelerations The error in the reference accelerations expressed as a percentage of the channel amplitude class shall be less than ± 1,5 % below 400 Hz, less than ± 2 % between 400 Hz and 900 Hz, and less than ± 2,5 % above 900 Hz. 2.6.2.3.   Time The relative error in the reference time shall be less than 10- 5 . 2.6.3.   Sensitivity coefficient and linearity error The sensitivity coefficient and the linearity error shall be determined by measuring the output signal of the data channel against a known input signal for various values of this signal. The calibration of the data channel shall cover the whole range of the amplitude class. For bi-directional channels, both the positive and negative values shall be used. If the calibration equipment cannot produce the required input owing to the excessively high values of the quantity to be measured, calibrations shall be carried out within the limits of the calibration standards and these limits shall be recorded in the test report. A total data channel shall be calibrated at a frequency or at a spectrum of frequencies having a significant value between F L and (F H /2,5). 2.6.4.   Calibration of the frequency response The response curves of phase and amplitude against frequency shall be determined by measuring the output signals of the data channel in terms of phase and amplitude against a known input signal, for various values of this signal varying between F L and 10 times the CFC or 3 000 Hz, whichever is lower. 2.7.   Environmental effects A regular check shall be made to identify any environmental influence (such as electric or magnetic flux, cable velocity, etc.). This can be done for instance by recording the output of spare channels equipped with dummy transducers. If significant output signals are obtained corrective action shall be taken, for instance by replacement of cables. 2.8.   Choice and designation of the data channel The CAC and CFC define a data channel. The CAC shall be 1, 2 or 5 to a power of 10. 3.   MOUNTING OF TRANSDUCERS Transducers should be rigidly secured so that their recordings are affected by vibration as little as possible. Any mounting having a lowest resonance frequency equal to at least 5 times the frequency FH of the data channel considered shall be considered valid. Acceleration transducers in particular should be mounted in such a way that the initial angle of the real measurement axis to the corresponding axis of the reference axis system is not greater than 5° unless an analytical or experimental assessment of the effect of the mounting on the collected data is made. When multi-axial accelerations at a point are to be measured, each acceleration transducer axis should pass within 10 mm of that point, and the centre of seismic mass of each accelerometer should be within 30 mm of that point. 4.   RECORDING 4.1.   Analogue magnetic recorder Tape speed should be stable to within not more than 0,5 % of the tape speed used. The signal-to-noise ratio of the recorder should not be less than 42 dB at the maximum tape speed. The total harmonic distortion should be less than 3 % and the linearity error should be less than 1 % of the measurement range. 4.2.   Digital magnetic recorder Tape speed should be stable to within not more than 10 % of the tape speed used. 4.3.   Paper tape recorder In case of direct data recording the paper speed in mm/s should be at least 1,5 times the number expressing FH in Hz. In other cases the paper speed should be such that equivalent resolution is obtained. 5.   DATA PROCESSING 5.1.   Filtering Filtering corresponding to the frequencies of the data channel class may be carried out during either recording or processing of data. However, before recording, analogical filtering at a higher level than CFC should be effected in order to use at least 50 % of the dynamic range of the recorder and to reduce the risk of high frequencies saturating the recorder or causing aliasing errors in the digitalising process. 5.2.   Digitalising 5.2.1.   Sampling frequency The sampling frequency should be equal to at least 8 F H . In the case of analogical recording, when the recording and reading speeds are different, the sampling frequency can be divided by the speed ratio. 5.2.2.   Amplitude resolution The size of digital words should be at least 7 bits and a parity bit. 6.   PRESENTATION OF RESULTS The results should be presented on A4 size paper (ISO/R 216). Results presented as diagrams should have axes scaled with a measurement unit corresponding to a suitable multiple of the chosen unit (for example, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 millimetres). SI units shall be used, except for vehicle velocity, where km/h may be used, and for accelerations due to impact where g, with g = 9,81 m/s 2 , may be used.

The following is a summary of the procedure that should be applied to materials for the frontal impact barrier, these materials having a crush strength of 0,342 MPa and 1,711 MPa respectively. 2.1.   Sample locations To ensure uniformity of crush strength across the whole of the barrier face, eight samples shall be taken from four locations evenly spaced across the honeycomb block. For a block to pass certification, seven of these eight samples shall meet the crush strength requirements of the following sections. The location of the samples depends on the size of the honeycomb block. First, four samples, each measuring 300 mm x 300 mm x 50 mm thick shall be cut from the block of barrier face material. Please refer to Figure 2 for an illustration of how to locate these sections within the honeycomb block. Each of these larger samples shall be cut into samples for certification testing (150 mm x 150 mm x 50 mm). Certification shall be based on the testing of two samples from each of these four locations. The other two should be made available to the applicant, upon request. 2.2.   Sample size Samples of the following size shall be used for testing: length : 150 mm ± 6 mm, width : 150 mm ± 6 mm, thickness : 50 mm ± 2 mm. The walls of incomplete cells around the edge of the sample shall be trimmed as follows: — in the ‘W’ direction, the fringes shall be no greater than 1,8 mm (see Figure 3); — In the ‘L’ direction, half the length of one bonded cell wall (in the ribbon direction) shall be left at either end of the specimen (see Figure 3). 2.3.   Area measurement The length of the sample shall be measured in three locations, 12,7 mm from each end and in the middle, and recorded as L1, L2 and L3 (Figure 3). In the same manner, the width shall be measured and recorded as W1, W2 and W3 (Figure 3). These measurements shall be taken on the centreline of the thickness. The crush area shall then be calculated as: 2.4.   Crush rate and distance The sample shall be crushed at a rate of not less than 5,1 mm/min and not more than 7,6 mm/min. The minimum crush distance shall be 16,5 mm. 2.5.   Data collection Force versus deflection data are to be collected in either analogue or digital form for each sample tested. If analogue data are collected then a means of converting this to digital shall be available. All digital data shall be collected at a rate of not less than 5 Hz (5 points per second). 2.6.   Crush strength determination Ignore all data prior to 6,4 mm of crush and after 16,5 mm of crush. Divide the remaining data into three sections or displacement intervals (n = 1, 2, 3) (see Figure 4) as follows: (1) 06,4 mm – 09,7 mm inclusive, (2) 09,7 mm – 13,2 mm exclusive, (3) 13,2 mm – 16,5 mm inclusive. Find the average for each section as follows: where m represents the number of data points measured in each of the three intervals. Calculate the crush strength of each section as follows: 2.7.   Sample crush strength specification For a honeycomb sample to pass this certification, the following conditions shall be met: 0,308 MPa ≤ S(n) ≤ 0,342 MPa for 0,342 MPa material, 1,540 MPa ≤ S(n) ≤ 1,711 MPa for 1,711 MPa material, n = 1, 2, 3. 2.8.   Block crush strength specification Eight samples are to be tested from four locations, evenly spaced across the block. For a block to pass certification, seven of the eight samples shall meet the crush strength specification of the previous section. 3.   ADHESIVE BONDING PROCEDURE 3.1.   Immediately before bonding, aluminium sheet surfaces to be bonded shall be thoroughly cleaned using a suitable solvent, such as 1-1-1 Trichloroethane. This is to be carried out at least twice or as required to eliminate grease or dirt deposits. The cleaned surfaces shall then be abraded using 120 grit abrasive paper. Metallic/silicon carbide abrasive paper is not to be used. The surfaces shall be thoroughly abraded and the abrasive paper changed regularly during the process to avoid clogging, which may lead to a polishing effect. Following abrading, the surfaces shall be thoroughly cleaned again, as above. In total, the surfaces shall be solvent cleaned at least four times. All dust and deposits left as a result of the abrading process shall be removed, as these will adversely affect bonding. 3.2.   The adhesive should be applied to one surface only, using a ribbed rubber roller. In cases where honeycomb is to be bonded to aluminium sheet, the adhesive should be applied to the aluminium sheet only. A maximum of 0,5 kg/m 2 shall be applied evenly over the surface, giving a maximum film thickness of 0,5 mm. 4.   CONSTRUCTION 4.1.   The main honeycomb block shall be bonded to the backing sheet with adhesive such that the cell axes are perpendicular to the sheet. The cladding shall be bonded to the front surface of the honeycomb block. The top and bottom surfaces of the cladding sheet shall not be bonded to the main honeycomb block but should be positioned closely to it. The cladding sheet shall be adhesively bonded to the backing sheet at the mounting flanges. 4.2.   The bumper element shall be adhesively bonded to the front of the cladding sheet such that the cell axes are perpendicular to the sheet. The bottom of the bumper element shall be flush with the bottom surface of the cladding sheet. The bumper facing sheet shall be adhesively bonded to the front of the bumper element. 4.3.   The bumper element shall then be divided into three equal sections by means of two horizontal slots. These slots shall be cut through the entire depth of the bumper section and extend the whole width of the bumper. The slots shall be cut using a saw; their width shall be the width of the blade used and shall not exceed 4,0 mm. 4.4.   Clearance holes for mounting the barrier are to be drilled in the mounting flanges (shown in Figure 5). The holes shall be of 9,5 mm diameter. Five holes shall be drilled in the top flange at a distance of 40 mm from the top edge of the flange and five in the bottom flange, 40 mm from the bottom edge of that flange. The holes shall be at 100 mm, 300 mm, 500 mm, 700 mm, 900 mm from either edge of the barrier. All holes shall be drilled to ± 1 mm of the nominal distances. These hole locations are a recommendation only. Alternative positions may be used which offer at least the mounting strength and security provided by the above mounting specifications. 5.   MOUNTING 5.1.   The deformable barrier shall be rigidly fixed to the edge of a mass of not less than 7 x 104 kg or to some structure attached thereto. The attachment of the barrier face shall be such that the vehicle shall not contact any part of the structure more than 75 mm from the top surface of the barrier (excluding the upper flange) during any stage of the impact ( 12 ) . The front face of the surface to which the deformable barrier is attached shall be flat and continuous over the height and width of the face and shall be vertical ± 1° and perpendicular ± 1° to the axis of the run-up track. The attachment surface shall not be displaced by more than 10 mm during the test. If necessary, additional anchorage or arresting devices shall be used to prevent displacement of the concrete block. The edge of the deformable barrier shall be aligned with the edge of the concrete block appropriate for the side of the vehicle to be tested. 5.2.   The deformable barrier shall be fixed to the concrete block by means of 10 bolts, five in the top mounting flange and five in the bottom. These bolts shall be of at least 8 mm diameter. Steel clamping strips shall be used for both the top and bottom mounting flanges (see Figures 1 and 5). These strips shall be 60 mm high and 1 000 mm wide and have a thickness of at least 3 mm. The edges of the clamping strips should be rounded-off to prevent tearing of the barrier against the strip during impact. The edge of the strip should be located no more than 5 mm above the base of the upper barrier mounting flange, or 5 mm below the top of the lower barrier-mounting flange. Five clearance holes of 9,5 mm diameter must be drilled in both strips to correspond with those in the mounting flange on the barrier (see paragraph 4). The mounting strip and barrier flange holes may be widened from 9,5 mm up to a maximum of 25 mm in order to accommodate differences in back-plate arrangements and/or load cell wall hole configurations. None of the fixtures shall fail in the impact test. In the case where the deformable barrier is mounted on a load cell wall (LCW) it should be noted that the above dimensional requirements for mountings are intended as a minimum. Where a LCW is present, the mounting strips may be extended to accommodate higher mounting holes for the bolts. If the strips are required to be extended, then thicker gauge steel should be used accordingly, such that the barrier does not pull away from the wall, bend or tear during the impact. If an alternative method of mounting the barrier is used, it should be at least as secure as that specified in the above paragraphs.

The test will be carried out on the driver’s side unless asymmetric side structures, if any, are so different as to affect the performance in a side impact. In that case either of the alternatives in paragraph 5.1.1.1 or 5.1.1.2 may be used by agreement between the manufacturer and test authority. 5.1.1.1.   The manufacturer will provide the authority responsible for approval with information regarding the compatibility of performances in comparison with the driver’s side when the test is being carried out on that side. 5.1.1.2.   The approval authority, if concerned as to the construction of the vehicle, will decide to have the test performed on the side opposite the driver, this being considered the least favourable. 5.1.2.   The Technical Service, after consultation with the manufacturer, may require the test to be carried out with the seat in a position other than the one indicated in paragraph 5.5.1 of Annex 4. This position shall be indicated in the test report ( 14 ) . 5.1.3.   The result of this test shall be considered satisfactory if the conditions set out in paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 are satisfied. Performance criteria The performance criteria, as determined for the collision test in accordance with the Appendix to Annex 4 to this Regulation shall meet the following conditions: 5.2.1.1.   the head performance criterion (HPC) shall be less than or equal to 1 000; when there is no head contact, then the HPC shall not be measured or calculated but recorded as ‘no head contact’; 5.2.1.2.   the thorax performance criteria shall be: (a) rib deflection criterion (RDC) less than or equal to 42 mm; (b) soft tissue criterion (VC) less or equal to 1,0 m/sec. For a transitional period of two years after the date specified in paragraph 10.2 of this Regulation the V * C value is not a pass/fail criterion for the approval testing, but this value has to be recorded in the test report and to be collected by the approval authorities. After this transitional period, the VC value of 1,0 m/sec shall apply as a pass/fail criterion unless the Contracting Parties applying this Regulation decide otherwise; 5.2.1.3.   the pelvis performance criterion shall be: pubic symphysis peak force (PSPF) less than or equal to 6 kN; 5.2.1.4.   the abdomen performance criterion shall be: abdominal peak force (APF) less than or equal to 2,5 kN internal force (equivalent to external force of 4,5 kN). Particular requirements 5.3.1.   No door shall open during the test. After the impact, it shall be possible without the use of tools to: 5.3.2.1.   open a sufficient number of doors provided for normal entry and exit of passengers, and if necessary tilt the seat-backs or seats to allow evacuation of all occupants; 5.3.2.2.   release the dummy from the protective system; 5.3.2.3.   remove the dummy from the vehicle; 5.3.3.   no interior device or component shall become detached in such a way as noticeably to increase the risk of injury from sharp projections or jagged edges; 5.3.4.   ruptures, resulting from permanent deformation are acceptable, provided these do not increase the risk of injury; 5.3.5.   if there is continuous leakage of liquid from the fuel-feed installation after the collision, the rate of leakage shall not exceed 30 g/min; if the liquid from the fuel-feed system mixes with liquids from the other systems and the various liquids cannot easily be separated and identified, all the liquids collected shall be taken into account in evaluating the continuous leakage. 6.   MODIFICATION OF THE VEHICLE TYPE Any modification affecting the structure, the number and type of seats, the interior trim or fittings, or the position of the vehicle controls or of mechanical parts which might affect the energy-absorption capacity of the side of the vehicle, shall be brought to the notice of the administrative department granting approval. The department may then either: 6.1.1.   consider that the modifications made are unlikely to have an appreciable adverse effect and that in any case the vehicle still complies with the requirements, or require a further test report from the technical service responsible for conducting the tests. 6.1.2.1.   Any modification of the vehicle affecting the general form of the structure of the vehicle or any variation in the reference mass greater than 8 % which in the judgement of the authority would have a marked influence on the results of the test shall require a repetition of the test as described in Annex 4. 6.1.2.2.   If the technical service, after consultation with the vehicle manufacturer, considers that modifications to a vehicle type are insufficient to warrant a complete retest then a partial test may be used. This would be the case if the reference mass is not more than 8 % different from the original vehicle or the number of front seats is unchanged. Variations of seat type or interior fittings need not automatically entail a full retest. An example of the approach to this problem is given in Annex 8. 6.2.   Confirmation or refusal of approval, specifying the alteration, shall be communicated by the procedure specified in paragraph 4.4 to the Parties to the Agreement which apply this Regulation. 6.3.   The competent authority issuing an extension of approval shall assign a series number to each communication form drawn up for such an extension. 7.   CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION The conformity of production procedures shall comply with those set out in the Agreement, Appendix 2 (E/ECE/324-E/ECE/TRANS/505/Rev.2), with the following requirements: 7.1.   Every vehicle approved under this Regulation shall be so manufactured as to conform to the type approved by meeting the requirements set out in paragraph 5. 7.2.   The holder of the approval shall ensure that for each type of vehicle at least the tests concerning the taking of measurements are carried out. 7.3.   The authority which has granted type approval may at any time verify the conformity control methods applied in each production facility. The normal frequency of these verifications shall be once every two years. 8.   PENALTIES FOR NON-CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION 8.1.   The approval granted in respect of a vehicle type, pursuant to this Regulation, may be withdrawn if the requirement laid down in paragraph 7.1. above is not complied with, or if the vehicle or vehicles selected have failed to pass the checks prescribed in paragraph 7.2. 8.2.   If a Contracting Party to the Agreement applying this Regulation withdraws an approval it has previously granted, it shall forthwith so notify the other Contracting Parties applying this Regulation by means of a communication form conforming to the model in Annex 1 to this Regulation. 9.   PRODUCTION DEFINITELY DISCONTINUED If the holder of the approval completely ceases to manufacture a type of vehicle approved in accordance with this Regulation, he shall so inform the authority which granted the approval. Upon receiving the relevant communication that authority shall inform thereof the other Parties to the 1958 Agreement applying this Regulation by means of a communication form conforming to the model in Annex 1 to this Regulation. 10.   TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS 10.1.   As from the official date of entry into force of the 02 series of amendments, no Contracting Party applying this Regulation shall refuse to grant ECE approval under this Regulation as amended by the 02 series of amendments. 10.2.   As from 12 months after the entry into force of the 02 series of amendments Contracting Parties applying this Regulation shall grant ECE approvals only to those types of vehicles which comply with the requirements of this Regulation as amended by the 02 series of amendments. 10.3.   As from 60 months after the entry into service of the 02 series of amendments Contracting Parties applying this Regulation may refuse first national registration (first entry into service) of vehicles which do not meet the requirements of this Regulation as amended by the 02 series of amendments. 11.   NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF TECHNICAL SERVICES RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING APPROVAL TESTS, AND OF ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS The Contracting Parties to the Agreement applying this Regulation shall communicate to the United Nations secretariat the names and addresses of the technical services responsible for conducting approval tests, and of the administrative departments which grant approval and to which forms certifying approval or extension, or refusal or withdrawal of approval, issued in other countries, are to be sent.

ANNEX 3 Procedure for determining the ‘H’ point and the actual torso angle for seating positions in motor vehicles 1.   PURPOSE The procedure described in this Annex is used to establish the ‘H’ point location and the actual torso angle for one or several seating positions in a motor vehicle and to verify the relationship of measured data to design specifications given by the vehicle manufacturer ( 16 ) . 2.   DEFINITIONS For the purposes of this Annex: ‘reference data’ means one or several of the following characteristics of a seating position: 2.1.1.   the ‘H’ point and the ‘R’ point and their relationship, 2.1.2.   the actual torso angle and the design torso angle and their relationship. 2.2.   ‘three-dimensional “H” point machine’ (3-D H machine) means the device used for the determination of ‘H’ points and actual torso angles. This device is described in Appendix 1 to this Annex; 2.3.   ‘“H” point’ means the pivot centre of the torso and the thigh of the 3-D H machine installed in the vehicle seat in accordance with paragraph 4 below. The ‘H’ point is located in the centre of the centreline of the device which is between the ‘H’ point sight buttons on either side of the 3-D H machine. The ‘H’ point corresponds theoretically to the ‘R’ point (for tolerances see paragraph 3.2.2). Once determined in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph 4, the ‘H’ point is considered fixed in relation to the seat-cushion structure and to move with it when the seat is adjusted; 2.4.   ‘“R” point’ or ‘seating reference point’ means a design point defined by the vehicle manufacturer for each seating position and established with respect to the three-dimensional reference system; 2.5.   ‘torso-line’ means the centreline of the probe of the 3-D H machine with the probe in the fully rearward position; 2.6.   ‘actual torso angle’ means the angle measured between a vertical line through the ‘H’ point and the torso line using the back angle quadrant on the 3-D H machine. The actual torso angle corresponds theoretically to the design torso angle (for tolerances see paragraph 3.2.2): 2.7.   ‘design torso angle’ means the angle measures between a vertical line through the ‘R’ point and the torso line in a position which corresponds to the design position of the seat-back established by the vehicle manufacturer; 2.8.   ‘centreplane of occupant’ (C/LO) means the median plane of the 3-D H machine positioned in each designated seating position; it is represented by the coordinate of the ‘H’ point on the ‘Y’ axis. For individual seats, the centreplane of the seat coincides with the centreplane of the occupant. For other seats, the centreplane of the occupant is specified by the manufacturer; 2.9.   ‘three-dimensional reference system’ means a system as described in Appendix 2 to this Annex; 2.10.   ‘fiducial marks’ are physical points (holes, surfaces, marks or indentations) on the vehicle body as defined by the manufacturer; 2.11.   ‘vehicle measuring attitude’ means the position of the vehicle as defined by the coordinates of fiducial marks in the three-dimensional reference system. 3.   REQUIREMENTS 3.1.   Data presentation For each seating position where reference data are required in order to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of the present Regulation, all or an appropriate selection of the following data shall be presented in the form indicated in Appendix 3 to this Annex: 3.1.1.   the coordinates of the ‘R’ point relative to the three-dimensional reference system; 3.1.2.   the design torso angle; 3.1.3.   all indications necessary to adjust the seat (if it is adjustable) to the measuring position set out in paragraph 4.3. 3.2.   Relationship between measured data and design specifications 3.2.1.   The coordinates of the ‘H’ point and the value of the actual torso angle obtained by the procedure set out in paragraph 4 shall be compared, respectively, with the coordinates of the ‘R’ point and the value of the design torso angle indicated by the vehicle manufacturer. 3.2.2.   The relative positions of the ‘R’ point and the ‘H’ point and the relationship between the design torso angle and the actual torso angle shall be considered satisfactory for the seating position in question if the ‘H’ point, as defined by its coordinates, lies within a square of 50 mm side length with horizontal and vertical sides whose diagonals intersect at the ‘R’ point, and if the actual torso angle is within 5° of the design torso angle. 3.2.3.   If these conditions are met, the ‘R’ point and the design torso angle, shall be used to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. 3.2.4.   If the ‘H’ point or the actual torso angle does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 3.2.2, the ‘H’ point and the actual torso angle shall be determined twice more (three times in all). If the results of two of these three operations satisfy the requirements, the conditions of paragraph 3.2.3 shall apply. 3.2.5.   If the results of at least two of the three operations described in paragraph 3.2.4 do not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 3.2.2, or if the verification cannot take place because the vehicle manufacturer has failed to supply information regarding the position of the ‘R’ point or regarding the design torso angle, the centroid of the three measured points or the average of the three measured angles shall be used and be regarded as applicable in all cases where the ‘R’ point or the design torso angle is referred to in this Regulation. 4.   PROCEDURE FOR ‘H’ POINT AND ACTUAL TORSO ANGLE DETERMINATION 4.1.   The vehicle shall be preconditioned at the manufacturer’s discretion, at a temperature of 20 ± 10 °C to ensure that the seat material reached room temperature. If the seat to be checked has never been sat upon, a 70 to 80 kg person or device shall sit on the seat twice for one minute to flex the cushion and back. At the manufacturer’s request, all seat assemblies shall remain unloaded for a minimum period of 30 minutes prior to installation of the 3-D H machine. 4.2.   The vehicle shall be at the measuring attitude defined in paragraph 2.11. 4.3.   The seat, if it is adjustable, shall be adjusted first to the rearmost normal driving or riding position, as indicated by the vehicle manufacturer, taking into consideration only the longitudinal adjustment of the seat, excluding seat travel used for purposes other than normal driving or riding positions. Where other modes of seat adjustment exist (vertical, angular, seat-back, etc.) these will then be adjusted to the position specified by the vehicle manufacturer. For suspension seats, the vertical position shall be rigidly fixed corresponding to a normal driving position as specified by the manufacturer. 4.4.   The area of the seating position contacted by the 3-D H machine shall be covered by a muslin cotton, of sufficient size and appropriate texture, described as a plain cotton fabric having 18.9 threads per cm 2 and weighing 0.228 kg/m 2 or knitted or non-woven fabric having equivalent characteristics. If the test is run on a seat outside the vehicle, the floor on which the seat is placed shall have the same essential characteristics ( 17 ) as the floor of the vehicle in which the seat is intended to be used. 4.5.   Place the seat and back assembly of the 3-D H machine so that the centreplane of the occupant (C/LO) coincides with the centreplane of the 3-D H machine. At the manufacturer’s request, the 3-D H machine may be moved inboard with respect to the C/LO if the 3-D H machine is located so far outboard that the seat edge will not permit levelling of the 3-D H machine. 4.6.   Attach the foot and lower leg assemblies to the seat pan assembly, either individually or by using the T-bar and lower leg assembly. A line through the ‘H’ point sight buttons shall be parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the longitudinal centreplane of the seat. Adjust the feet and leg positions of the 3-D H machine as follows: Designated seating position: driver and outside front passenger 4.7.1.1.   Both feet and leg assemblies shall be moved forward in such a way that the feet take up natural positions on the floor, between the operating pedals if necessary. Where possible the left foot shall be located approximately the same distance to the left of the centreplane of the 3-D H machine as the right foot is to the right. The spirit level verifying the transverse orientation of the 3-D H machine is brought to the horizontal by readjustment of the seat pan if necessary, or by adjusting the leg and foot assemblies towards the rear. The line passing through the ‘H’ point sight buttons shall be maintained perpendicular to the longitudinal centreplane of the seat. 4.7.1.2.   If the left leg cannot be kept parallel to the right leg and the left foot cannot be supported by the structure, move the left foot until it is supported. The alignment of the sight buttons shall be maintained. 4.7.2.   Designated seating position: outboard rear For rear seats or auxiliary seats, the legs are located as specified by the manufacturer. If the feet then rest on parts of the floor which are at different levels, the foot which first comes into contact with the front seat shall serve as a reference and the other foot shall be so arranged that the spirit level giving the transverse orientation of the seat of the device indicates the horizontal. 4.7.3.   Other designated seating positions: The general procedure indicated in paragraph 4.7.1 shall be followed except that the feet shall be placed as specified by the vehicle manufacturer. 4.8.   Apply lower leg and thigh weights and level the 3-D H machine. Tilt the back pan forward against the forward stop and draw the 3-D H machine away from the seat-back using the T-bar. Reposition the 3-D H machine on the seat by one of the following methods: 4.9.1.   If the 3-D H machine tends to slide rearward, use the following procedure. Allow the 3-D H machine to slide rearward until a forward horizontal restraining load on the T-bar is no longer required i.e. until the seat pan contacts the seat-back. If necessary, reposition the lower leg. 4.9.2.   If the 3-D H machine does not tend to slide rearward, use the following procedure. Slide the 3-D H machine rearwards by applying a horizontal rearward load to the T-bar until the seat pan contacts the seat-back (see Figure 2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex). 4.10.   Apply a 100 ± 10 N load to the back and pan assembly of the 3-D H machine at the intersection of the hip angle quadrant and the T-bar housing. The direction of load application shall be maintained along a line passing by the above intersection to a point just above the thigh bar housing (see Figure 2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex). Then carefully return the back pan to the seat-back. Care must be exercised throughout the remainder of the procedure to prevent the 3-D H machine from sliding forward. 4.11.   Install the right and left buttock weights and then, alternately, the eight torso weights. Maintain the 3-D H machine level. 4.12.   Tilt the back pan forward to release the tension on the seat-back. Rock the 3-D H machine from side to side through a 10° arc (5° to each side of the vertical centreplane) for three complete cycles to release any accumulated friction between the 3-D H machine and the seat. During the rocking action, the T-bar of the 3-D H machine may tend to diverge from the specified horizontal and vertical alignment. The T-bar must therefore be restrained by applying an appropriate lateral load during the rocking motions. Care shall be exercised in holding the T-bar and rocking the 3-D H machine to ensure that no inadvertent exterior loads are applied in a vertical or fore and aft direction. The feet of the 3-D H machine are not to be restrained or held during this step. If the feet change position, they should be allowed to remain in that attitude for the moment. Carefully return the back pan to the seat-back and check the two spirits levels for zero position. If any movement of the feet has occurred during the rocking operation of the 3-D H machine, they must be repositioned as follows: Alternately, lift each foot off the floor the minimum necessary amount until no additional foot movement is obtained. During this lifting, the feet are to be free to rotate; and no forward or lateral loads are to be applied. When each foot is placed back in the down position, the heel is to be in contact with the structure designed for this. Check the lateral spirit level for zero position; if necessary, apply a lateral load to the top of the back pan sufficient to level the 3-D H machine’s seat pan on the seat. 4.13.   Holding the T-bar to prevent the 3-D H machine from sliding forward on the seat cushion, proceed as follows: (a) return the back pan to the seat-back; (b) alternately apply and release a horizontal rearward load, not to exceed 25 N, to the back angle bar at a height approximately at the centre of the torso weights until the hip angle quadrant indicates that a stable position has been reached after load release. Care shall be exercised to ensure that no exterior downward or lateral loads are applied to the 3-D H machine. If another level adjustment of the 3-D H machine is necessary, rotate the back pan forward, re-level, and repeat the procedure from paragraph 4.12. Take all measurements: 4.14.1.   The coordinates of the ‘H’ point are measured with respect to the three-dimensional reference system. 4.14.2.   The actual torso angle is read at the back angle quadrant of the 3-D H machine with the probe in its fully rearward position. 4.15.   If a re-run of the installation of the 3-D H machine is desired, the seat assembly should remain unloaded for a minimum period of 30 min prior to the re-run. The 3-D H machine should not be left loaded on the seat assembly longer than the time required to perform the test. If the seats in the same row can be regarded as similar (bench seat, identical seats, etc.) only one ‘H’ point and one ‘actual torso angle’ shall be determined for each row of seats, the 3-D H machine described in Appendix 1 to this Annex being seated in a place regarded as representative for the row. This place shall be: 4.16.1.   in the case of the front row, the driver’s seat; 4.16.2.   in the case of the rear row or rows, an outer seat. Appendix 1 Description of the three-dimensional ‘H’ point machine ( 18 ) (3-D H machine) 1.   BACK AND SEAT PANS The back and seat pans are constructed of reinforced plastic and metal; they simulate the human torso and thigh and are mechanically hinged at the ‘H’ point. A quadrant is fastened to the probe hinged at the ‘H’ point to measure the actual torso angle. An adjustable thigh bar, attached to the seat pan, establishes the thigh centreline and serves as a baseline for the hip angle quadrant. 2.   BODY AND LEG ELEMENTS Lower leg segments are connected to the seat pan assembly at the T-bar joining the knees, which is a lateral extension of the adjustable thigh bar. Quadrants are incorporated in the lower leg segments to measure knee angles. Shoe and foot assemblies are calibrated to measure the foot angle. Two spirit levels orient the device in space. Body element weights are placed at the corresponding centres of gravity to provide seat penetration equivalent to a 76 kg male. All joints of the 3-D H machine should be checked for free movement without encountering noticeable friction. Appendix 2 Three-dimensional reference system 1.   The three-dimensional reference system is defined by three orthogonal planes established by the vehicle manufacturer ( 19 ) . 2.   The vehicle measuring attitude is established by positioning the vehicle on the supporting surface such that the coordinates of the fiducial marks correspond to the values indicated by the manufacturer. 3.   The coordinates of the ‘R’ point and the ‘H’ point are established in relation to the fiducial marks defined by the vehicle manufacturer. Appendix 3 Reference data concerning seating positions 1.   Coding of reference data Reference data are listed consecutively for each seating position. Seating positions are identified by a two-digit code. The first digit is an Arabic numeral and designates the row of seats, counting from the front to the rear of the vehicle.

For rotational adjustments (tilt), rearward will be the adjustment direction which moves the head of the dummy rearwards. If the dummy protrudes outside the normal passenger volume, e.g. head into roof lining, then 1 cm clearance will be provided using: secondary adjustments, seat-back angle, or fore-aft adjustment in that order. 5.6.   Unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer, the other front seats shall, if possible, be adjusted to the same position as the seat containing the dummy. 5.7.   If the steering wheel is adjustable, all adjustments are positioned to their mid-travel locations. 5.8.   Tyres shall be inflated to the pressure specified by the vehicle manufacturer. 5.9.   The test vehicle shall be set horizontal about its roll axis and maintained by supports in that position until the side impact dummy is in place and after all preparatory work is complete. 5.10.   The vehicle shall be at its normal attitude corresponding to the conditions set out in paragraph 4.3.

HPC is the maximum value of the expression: where a is the resultant acceleration at the centre of gravity of the head in metres per second per second divided by 9,81 recorded versus time and filtered at channel frequency class 1 000 Hz; t 1 and t 2 are any two times between the initial contact and the last instant of the final contact. 2.   THORAX PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 2.1.   Chest deflection: the peak chest deflection is the maximum value of deflection on any rib as determined by the thorax displacement transducers, filtered at channel frequency class 180 Hz. 2.2.   Viscous criterion: the peak viscous response is the maximum value of VC on any rib which is calculated from the instantaneous product of the relative thorax compression related to the half thorax and the velocity of compression derived by differentiation of the compression, filtered at channel frequency class 180 Hz. For the purposes of this calculation the standard width of the half thorax rib cage is 140 mm. where D (metres) = rib deflection The calculation algorithm to be used is set out in Annex 4, Appendix 2. 3.   ABDOMEN PROTECTION CRITERION The peak abdominal force is the maximum value of the sum of the three forces measured by transducers mounted 39 mm below the surface on the crash side, CFC 600 Hz. 4.   PELVIS PERFORMANCE CRITERION The pubic symphysis peak force (PSPF) is the maximum force measured by a load cell at the pubic symphysis of the pelvis, filtered at channel frequency class 600 Hz. Appendix 2 The procedure for calculating the viscous criterion for Eurosid 1 The Viscous Criterion, VC, is calculated as the instantaneous product of the compression and the rate of deflection of the rib. Both are derived from the measurement of rib deflection. The rib deflection response is filtered once at Channel Frequency Class 180. The compression at time (t) is calculated as the deflection from this filtered signal expressed as the proportion of the half width of the Eurosid 1 chest, measured at the metal ribs (0,14 metres): The rib deflection velocity at time ∂(t) is calculated from the filtered deflection as: where D(t) is the deflection at time ∂(t) in metres and t is the time interval in seconds between the measurements of deflection. The maximum value of t shall be 1,25 x 10 - 4 seconds.

All the necessary steps must be taken to restore conformity of the corresponding production; 4.2.   The manufacturer’s level of certification must be at least ISO 9002 standard; 4.3.   Minimum conditions for the control of production: the holder of an agreement will ensure the control of conformity following the methods hereunder described; 4.4.   Examples of sampling according to batch 4.4.1.   If several examples of one block type are constructed from one original block of aluminium honeycomb and are all treated in the same treatment bath (parallel production), one of these examples could be chosen as the sample, provided care is taken to ensure that the treatment is evenly applied to all blocks. If not, it may be necessary to select more than one sample. 4.4.2.   If a limited number of similar blocks (say three to 20) are treated in the same bath (serial production), then the first and last block treated in a batch, all of which are constructed from the same original block of aluminium honeycomb, should be taken as representative samples. If the first sample complies with the requirements but the last does not, it may be necessary to take further samples from earlier in the production until a sample that does comply is found. Only the blocks between these samples should be considered to be approved. 4.4.3.   Once experience is gained with the consistency of production control, it may be possible to combine both sampling approaches, so that more than one groups of parallel production can be considered to be a batch provided samples from the first and last production groups comply. 5.   STATIC TESTS 5.1.   One or more samples (according to the batch method) taken from each batch of processed honeycomb core shall be tested, according to the following test procedure: 5.2.   The sample size of the aluminium honeycomb for static tests shall be the size of a normal block of the impactor, that is to say 250 mm x 500 mm x 440 mm for top row and 250 mm x 500 mm x 500 mm for the bottom row. 5.3.   The samples should be compressed between two parallel loading plates which are at least 20 mm larger that the block cross section. 5.4.   The compression speed shall be 100 millimetres per minute, with a tolerance of 5 %. 5.5.   The data acquisition for static compression shall be sampled at a minimum of 5 Hz. 5.6.   The static test shall be continued until the block compression is at least 300 mm for blocks 4 to 6 and 350 mm for blocks 1 to 3. 6.   DYNAMIC TESTS For every 100 barrier faces produced, the manufacturer shall make one dynamic test against a dynamometric wall supported by a fixed rigid barrier, according to the method described below. 6.1.   Installation 6.1.1.   Testing ground 6.1.1.1.   The test area shall be large enough to accommodate the run-up-track of the mobile deformable barrier, the rigid barrier and the technical equipment necessary for the test. The last part of the track, for at least five metres before the rigid barrier, shall be horizontal, flat and smooth. 6.1.2.   Fixed rigid barrier and dynamometric wall. 6.1.2.1.   The rigid wall shall consist of a block of reinforced concrete not less than three metres wide and not less than 1,5 metres high. The thickness of the rigid wall shall be such that it weighs at least 70 tonnes. 6.1.2.2.   The front face shall be vertical, perpendicular to the axis of the run-up-tack and equipped with six load cell plates, each capable of measuring the total load on the appropriate block of the mobile deformable barrier impactor at the moment of impact. The load cell impact plate area centres shall align with those of the six impact zones of the mobile deformable barrier face. Their edges shall clear adjacent areas by 20 mm such that, within the tolerance of impact alignment of the MDB, the impact zones will not contact the adjacent impact plate areas. Cell mounting and plate surfaces shall be in accordance with the requirements set out in the Annex to standard ISO 6487:1987. 6.1.2.3.   Surface protection, comprising a plywood face (thickness: 12 ± 1 mm), is added to each load cell plate such that it shall not degrade the transducer responses. 6.1.2.4.   The rigid wall shall be either anchored in the ground or placed on the ground with, if necessary, additional arresting devices to limit its deflection. A rigid wall (to which the load cells are attached) having different characteristics but giving results that are at least equally conclusive may be used. 6.2.   Propulsion of the mobile deformable barrier At the moment of impact the mobile deformable barrier shall no longer be subject to the action of any additional steering or propelling device. It shall reach the obstacle on a course perpendicular to the front surface of the dynamometric wall. Impact alignment shall be accurate to within 10 mm. 6.3.   Measuring instruments 6.3.1.   Speed The impact speed shall be 35 ± 0,5 km/h the instrument used to record the speed on impact shall be accurate to within 0,1 %. 6.3.2.   Loads Measuring instruments shall meet the specifications set forth in ISO 6487:1987 CFC for all blocks : 60 Hz CAC for blocks 1 and 3 : 200 kN CAC for blocks 4,5 and 6 : 100 kN CAC for block 2 : 200 kN 6.3.3.   Acceleration 6.3.3.1.   The acceleration in the longitudinal direction shall be measured at three separate positions on the trolley, one centrally and one at each side, at places not subject to bending. 6.3.3.2.   The central accelerometer shall be located within 500 mm of the location of the centre of gravity of the MDB and shall lie in a vertical longitudinal plane which is within ± 10 mm of the centre of gravity of the MDB. 6.3.3.3.   The side accelerometers shall be at the same height as each other ± 10 mm and at the same distance from the front surface of the MDB ± 20 mm 6.3.3.4.   The instrumentation shall comply with ISO 6487:1987 with the following specifications: CFC 1,000 Hz (before integration) CAC 50 g 6.4.   General specifications of barrier 6.4.1.   The individual characteristics of each barrier shall comply with paragraph 1 of this Annex and shall be recorded. 6.5.   General specifications of the impactor 6.5.1.   The suitability of an impactor as regards the dynamic test requirements shall be confirmed when the outputs from the six load cell plates each produce signals complying with the requirements indicated in this Annex. 6.5.2.   Impactors shall carry consecutive serial numbers which are stamped, etched or otherwise permanently attached, from which the batches for the individual blocks and the date of manufacture can be established. 6.6.   Data processing procedure 6.6.1.   Raw data: At time T = T0, all offsets should be removed from the data. The method by which offsets are removed shall be recorded in the test report. 6.6.2.   Filtering 6.6.2.1.   The raw data will be filtered prior to processing/calculations. 6.6.2.2.   Accelerometer data for integration will be filtered to CFC 180, ISO 6487:1987. 6.6.2.3.   Accelerometer data for impulse calculations will be filtered to CFC 60, ISO 6487:1987. 6.6.2.4.   Load cell data will be filtered to CFC 60, ISO 6487:1987. 6.6.3.   Calculation of MDB face deflection 6.6.3.1.   Accelerometer data from all three accelerometers individually (after filtering at CFC 180), will be integrated twice to obtain deflection of the barrier deformable element. The initial conditions for deflection are: 6.6.3.2.1.   velocity = impact velocity (from speed measuring device). 6.6.3.2.2.   deflection = 0 6.6.3.3.   The deflection at the left hand side, mid-line and right hand side of the mobile deformable barrier will be plotted with respect to time. 6.6.3.4.   The maximum deflection calculated from each of the three accelerometers should be within 10 mm. If it is not the case, then the outlier should be removed and difference between the deflection calculated from the remaining two accelerometers checked to ensure that it is within 10 mm. 6.6.3.5.   If the deflections as measured by the left hand side, right hand side and mid-line accelerometers are within 10 mm, then the mean acceleration of the three accelerometers should be used to calculate the deflection of the barrier face. 6.6.3.6.   If the deflection from only two accelerometers meets the 10 mm requirement, then the mean acceleration from these two accelerometers should be used to calculate the deflection for the barrier face. 6.6.3.7.   If the deflections calculated from all three accelerometers (left hand side, right hand side and mid-line) are not within the 10 mm requirement, then the raw data should be reviewed to determine the causes of such large variation. In this case the individual test house will determine which accelerometer data should be used to determine mobile deformable barrier deflection or whether none of the accelerometer readings can be used, in which case, the certification test must be repeated. A full explanation should be given in the test report. 6.6.3.8.   The mean deflection-time data will be combined with the load cell wall force-time data to generate the force deflection result for each block. 6.6.4.   Calculation of energy The absorbed energy for each block and for the whole MDB face should be calculated up to the point of peak deflection of the barrier. where: t 0 is the time of first contact t 1 is the time where the trolley comes to rest, i.e. where u = 0. s is the deflection of the trolley deformable element calculated according to paragraph 6.6.3. 6.6.5.   Verification of dynamic force data 6.6.5.1.   Compare the total impulse, I, calculated from the integration of the total force over the period of contact, with the momentum change over that period (M*V). 6.6.5.2.   Compare the total energy change to the change in kinetic energy of the MDB, given by: where V i is the impact velocity and M the whole mass of the MDB If the momentum change (M*V) is not equal to the total impulse (I) ± 5 %, or if the total energy absorbed (E En) is not equal to the kinetic energy, EK ± 5 %, then the test data must be examined to determine the cause of this error.

In these tests the dummy is seated on a flat surface with two sheets of less than or equal to 2 mm thick Teflon, placed between the dummy and the surface. 5.4.4.   All parts to be certified should be kept in the test room for a period of at least four hours at a temperature between 18 °C and 22 °C prior to a test. 5.4.5.   The time between two repeated certification tests should be at least 30 minutes. 5.5.   Head 5.5.1.   The head is dropped from 200 ± 1 mm onto a flat, rigid impact surface. 5.5.2.   The angle between the impact surface and the mid-sagittal plane of the head is 35° ± 1° allowing an impact of the upper-side of the head. 5.5.3.   The peak resultant head acceleration, filtered using CFC 1 000, should be between 100 g and 150 g. 5.5.4.   The head performance can be adjusted to meet the requirement by altering the friction characteristics of the flesh-skull interface (e.g. by lubrication with talcum powder or PTFE spray). 5.6.   Neck 5.6.1.   The head-neck interface of the neck is mounted to a special symmetrical certification headform with a mass of 3,9 ± 0,05 kg (see Figure 4). 5.6.2.   The head form and neck are mounted upside-down to the bottom of a neck-bending pendulum allowing a lateral motion of the system. 5.6.3.   The neck-pendulum is equipped with a uniaxial accelerometer mounted at 1 655 ± 5 mm from the pendulum pivot. 5.6.4.   The neck-pendulum should be allowed to fall freely from a height chosen to achieve an impact velocity of 3,4 ± 0,1 m/s measured at the accelerometer location. 5.6.5.   The neck-pendulum is decelerated from impact velocity to zero by an appropriate device, resulting in a deceleration-time history inside the corridor specified in Figure 5 of this Annex. All measured rotations are recorded using CFC 1 000 filters. All measured rotations are filtered digitally, using ISO CFC 180. The pendulum deceleration is filtered with CFC 60. 5.6.6.   The maximum head form flexion angle relative to the pendulum should be 51 ± 5° and should occur between 50 and 62 ms. 5.6.7.   The maximum fore (A) and aft (B) neck base angles should be 32,0 ± 2,0° and 28,0 ± 2,0° respectively.

Impact velocities should not vary from those specified by more than 2 %. 5.9.6.   The rib displacement should be measured, for instance using the rib’s own displacement transducer. 5.9.7.   The rib certification requirements are shown in Table 4 of this Annex. 5.9.8.   The performance of the rib module can be adjusted by replacing the tuning spring inside the cylinder with one of a different stiffness.

All measured rotations are recorded using ISO CFC 1 000 filters. All measured rotations are filtered digitally, using ISO CFC 180. The pendulum deceleration is filtered with CFC 60. 5.10.6.   The maximum head form flexion angle relative to the pendulum should be 50 ± 5° and should occur between 39 and 53 ms. 5.10.7.   The maximum fore (A) and aft (B) spine base angles should be 33,0 ± 2,0° and 29,0 ± 2,0° respectively. These maxima should occur between 45 and 55 ms. 5.10.8.   The performance of the lumbar spine can be adjusted by changing the length of the spine. 5.11.   Abdomen 5.11.1.   The dummy is seated on a flat, horizontal, rigid surface with no back support.

ANNEX 7 Installation of the side impact dummy 1.   GENERAL 1.1.   The side impact dummy to be used for the following installation procedure is described in Annex 6 of this Regulation. 2.   INSTALLATION 2.1.   Adjust the leg joints so that they just support the leg when it is extended horizontally (1 to 2 g). 2.2.   Clothe the dummy in form-fitting cotton stretch underwear with short sleeves and mid-calf length pants. Each foot is equipped with a shoe. 2.3.   Place the dummy in the outboard front seat of the impacted side as described in the side impact test procedure specification. 2.4.   The plane of symmetry of the dummy shall coincide with the vertical median plane of the specified seating position. 2.5.   The pelvis of the dummy shall be positioned such that a lateral line passing through the dummy ‘H’ points is perpendicular to the longitudinal centre plane of the seat. The line through the dummy ‘H’ points shall be horizontal with a maximum inclination of ± 2 degrees. 2.6.   The upper torso shall be bent forward and then laid back firmly against the seat back. The shoulders of the dummy shall be set fully rearward. 2.7.   Irrespective of the seating position of the dummy, the angle between the upper arm and the torso arm reference line on each side shall be 40° ± 5°. The torso arm reference line is defined as the intersection of the plane tangential to the front surface of the ribs and the longitudinal vertical plane of the dummy containing the arm. 2.8.   For the driver’s seating position, without inducing pelvis or torso movement, place the right foot of the dummy on the undepressed accelerator pedal with the heel resting as far forward as possible on the floorpan. Set the left foot perpendicular to the lower leg with the heel resting on the floorpan in the same lateral line as the right heel. Set the knees of the dummy such that their outside surfaces are 150 ± 10 mm from the plane of symmetry of the dummy. If possible within these contraints place the thighs of the dummy in contact with the seat cushion. 2.9.   For other seating positions, without inducing pelvis or torso movement, place the heels of the dummy as far forward as possible on the floorpan without compressing the seat cushion more than the compression due to the weight of the leg. Set the knees of the dummy such that their outside surfaces are 150 ± 10 mm from the plane of symmetry of the dummy. ANNEX 8 Partial test 1.   PURPOSE The purpose of these tests is to verify whether the modified vehicle presents at least the same (or better) energy absorption characteristics than the vehicle type approved under this Regulation. 2.   PROCEDURES AND INSTALLATIONS 2.1.   Reference tests Using the initial padding materials tested during the approval of the vehicle, mounted in a new lateral structure of the vehicle to be approved, two dynamic tests, utilizing two different impactors shall be carried out (Figure 1). 2.1.1.1.   The head form impactor, defined in paragraph 3.1.1, shall hit at 24,1 km/h, in the area impacted for the Eurosid head during the approval of the vehicle. Test result shall be recorded, and the HPC calculated. However, this test shall not be carried out when, during the tests described in Annex 4 of this Regulation: where there has been no head contact, or when the head contacted the window glazing only, provided that the window glazing is not laminated glass. 2.1.1.2.   The body block impactor, defined in paragraph 3.2.1., shall hit at 24,1 km/h in the lateral area impacted by the Eurosid shoulder, arm and thorax, during the approval of the vehicle. Test result shall be recorded, and the HPC calculated. 2.2.   Approval test Using the new padding materials, seat, etc. presented for the approval extension, and mounted in a new lateral structure of the vehicle, tests specified in paragraphs 2.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.2, shall be repeated, the new results recorded, and their HPC calculated. 2.2.1.1.   If the HPC calculated from the results of both approval tests are lower than the HPC obtained during the reference tests (carried out using the original type approved padding materials or seats), the extension shall be granted. 2.2.1.2.   If the new HPC are greater than the HPC obtained during the reference tests, a new full scale test (using the proposed padding/seats/etc.) shall be carried out. 3.   TEST EQUIPMENT 3.1.   Head form impactor (Figure 2) 3.1.1.   This apparatus consists of a fully guided linear impactor, rigid, with a mass of 6,8 kg. Its impact surface is hemispherical with a diameter of 165 mm. 3.1.2.   The head form shall be fitted with two accelerometers and a speed-measuring device, all capable of measuring values in the impact direction. 3.2.   Body block impactor (Figure 3) 3.2.1.   This apparatus consists of a fully guided linear impactor, rigid, with a mass of 30 kg.

( 21 ) The amounts of energy indicated are the amounts of energy dissipated by the system when the extent to which the impactor is crushed is greatest. ( 22 ) All dimensions are in mm. The tolerances on the dimensins of the blocks allow for the difficulties of measuring cut aluminium honeycomb. The tolerance on the overall dimension of the impactor is less than that for the individual blocks since the honeycomb blocks can be adjusted, with overlap if necessary, to maintain a more closely defined impact face dimension ( 23 ) Until the publication of appropriate ISO Standards these documents (EUROSID-1 User's Manual: Delft, November 1990) can be obtained from TNO Road Vehicles Research Institute, P.O.

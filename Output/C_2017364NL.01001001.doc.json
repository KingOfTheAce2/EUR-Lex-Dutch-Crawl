Annex A The Charter of the European Greens European Green Party Guiding Principles Adopted at 2nd EGP Congress, Geneva, 13-14 October 2006 Who we are The European Greens proudly stand for the sustainable development of humanity on planet Earth, a mode of development respectful of human rights and built upon the values of environmental responsibility, freedom, justice, diversity and non-violence. Green political movements emerged in Europe while the continent was divided by the Cold War and amidst the energy crises of the mid-seventies. At that time, it became clear that the pattern of economic development was unsustainable and was putting the planet and its inhabitants in grave environmental, social and economic dangers. Existing political parties were incapable of dealing with this challenge. Our origins lie in many social movement: environmentalists and anti-nuclear activists concerned with the growing damages to our planet; non-violent peace activists promoting alternative ways to resolve conflicts; feminists, struggling for real equality between women and men; freedom and human rights movements fighting against dictatorial and authoritarian regimes; third-world solidarity movements supporting the end of colonization and more economically balanced relations between the North and the South of our planet; activists campaigning against poverty and for social justice within our own societies. From these origins, European Greens have come together to form our own political family. We stand for a free, democratic and social Europe in a peaceful, equitable and environmentally sustainable world. We defend values like justice, human and citizen's rights, solidarity, sustainability and the right of each individual to lead their own lives, free from fear. From the beginning, Greens have advocated thinking globally and acting locally. To develop cooperation at European level, a coordination body was founded in 1984, transforming itself in 1993 into the European Federation of Green Parties. In 2004, underlining the objective of a deeper cooperation, the Federation was transformed again into the European Green Party. European Greens are part of a thriving global Green movement. Guiding principles The guiding principles which provide the framework to the political actions by the member parties of the European Green Party can be defined as follows: I. Environmental Responsibility Taking responsibility for our biosphere is a central tenet of Green values. Society depends on the ecological resources and the health and resilience of the planet, and we bear an over-riding obligation to future generations to protect this inheritance. We advocate strongly the need to live within our ecological means. We must maintain biological diversity and combat global warming through sustainable use of renewable resources and the careful husbandry of non-renewable resources. The responsible use of bio-diversity is of critical importance for meeting the food, health and other needs of the growing world population. But beyond any notion of utility, Greens believe that each of the diverse species of life on our planet has an intrinsic value and beauty and therefore deserves to be protected. Our European pattern of production, consumption and commerce are contributing to the continued poverty of the majority of the planet's inhabitants and causing severe environmental degradation and climatic instability. Industrialised and industrialising countries can no longer postpone action to respond to these challenges. The urgent need to change these patterns necessarily means a profound adjustment process if we are to reverse this damaging exploitation of our common home. The political challenge facing us is the task to restructure the global agenda so that economic and trade policies serve social and environmental objectives and not just economic indices. Our answer is sustainable development, which integrates environmental, social and economic objectives for the benefit of all. Sustainable development can only be achieved through global cooperation to overcome the economic contradictions between the developing countries, the emerging economies and the industrialised world. Every citizen of the world has the same right to a fair share of the world's resources and also bears the same obligation to ensure that future generations can enjoy the same benefits. Greens always seek to apply the precautionary principle. We will not support measures which present potential threats to human health or environmental well-being. But neither will we accept delay in implementation of new precautionary measures solely on the ground that scientific studies are not sufficiently numerous. Whatever the domain, - peace, energy, food and agriculture, life sciences, transport, technology, medicine, –decisions and action must systematically follow the least harmful option. Specifically as regards nuclear energy, Greens stand for a nuclear-free Europe, because of the civil and military threats it poses, because of the burden it puts onto the future generations and because of the security apparatus it needs. For Greens, the priority is to develop decentralized and renewable alternative energies. II. Freedom through Self-Determination: Individual autonomy We Greens believe all human beings — regardless of sex, age, sexual orientation or identity, ethnic origin or disability- have the right to make their own choices, to express themselves freely and to shape their own lives. This freedom is not exclusively about material possessions; it includes the social, cultural, intellectual and spiritual dimensions of human life. These inalienable rights should be guaranteed by law and taught in schools as basic foundations of our societies. They should be fulfilled by empowerment of the people, by the opportunity for all women and men to make a living for themselves and their families and, where necessary, by social and material support, sufficient to lead a dignified life and to fully participate in society. Where these rights are lacking, we Greens will fight for them, proposing solidarity, education, development cooperation and protection from violence, oppression, and discrimination. Inclusive democracy Our belief in democracy is founded upon the mutual recognition of all individuals as equals. To encourage a maximum level of commitment, the political and decision-making processes have to be democratic, inclusive, transparent and fully accessible in a way comprehensible to ordinary citizens. The radical changes needed for sustainable development require that all take a common responsibility and a fair share of the burden. Elected representatives have the duty to consult and fully inform their constituents throughout the whole decision making process. We must always think globally, even whilst acting locally. To ensure the highest level of citizens' involvement and benefit, the authority to decide should be vested in the lowest effective level. Conversely, whenever a problem requires action on a higher level, the consequences for the lower levels should be taken into account and differences respected. Minority interests must be given adequate attention and protection. We are committed to strengthening democracy throughout Europe, at local, regional, national and supra-national levels. We want to strengthen the democratic responsibility and accountability of multi-lateral institutions. III. Extending Justice: Green policies are based on the principle of justice. This demands a fair distribution of society's goods and this, in turn, requires special attention to the needs of the weakest. Attention to the weakest is especially of importance at the global level, where Europe has a specific responsibility to stimulate economic growth in the developing countries. Because we have to address the problems of a changing world, our notion of justice goes far beyond traditional redistribution policies. Greens stand for social justice, for gender equity, for justice between generations, and for justice at the global level. Despite the practical conflicts arising between them, these dimensions of justice must not be played off against each other. Social justice ensures that everyone has access to vital societal resources: education, work and democratic participation. Fair access must be defended in the face of existing social imbalances, and needs to be institutionally safeguarded. Education is a decisive factor in the ability to shape one's own life. Using our labour skills enables us to bear the fruits of our abilities and thus defines a key part of our identity. Democratic participation is a basic requirement for becoming involved in society and helping to shape it. Gender equity. Justice is also gender equity. Women and men should enjoy the same power to define how society will develop. Moreover, they should be able to live their lives free from violence. We Greens want to develop the institutional framework which guarantees women equality at home, at work, in public office and in other positions of influence. We want to facilitate the harmonisation of family and professional life for both genders. Justice between the generations. The motto ‘We have only borrowed the world from our children’ is more appropriate today than ever before. Today, our children's future is at risk. Justice between generations means an obligation for the older generation to hand down our environmental, social and cultural heritage to the younger ones in a sustainable way. It also includes an obligation for the younger generations to care for the elder population. It should be ensured that all generations can participate fully in society. Global justice. Justice is also our yardstick on the international level. As the global economy connects people and increases our interdependence, this moral obligation also becomes a practical imperative. Worldwide sustainable development and universal human rights are at the core of our concept of global justice. These must be underpinned by an independent institutional monitoring framework for corporate social responsibility and fair trade. Justice requires solidarity, non-discrimination and citizens' involvement. Solidarity helps create self-confident individuals — it strengthens citizens instead of patronising them. All public authorities should work in partnership with citizens to create and defend institutions that enhance solidarity. For this reason we also want to invest in networks and communities, which, with state encouragement, practice mutual support. IV. Diversity, an Indispensable Condition The richness of civilisations, societies, and cultures has developed through diversification. We Greens are ourselves the result of the merging of a host of social movements, and we believe diversity is a condition for success, survival even, in almost every field of activity. Diversity increases the resilience of organisations and groups whenever they are confronted with unexpected changes. It is a safeguard against intolerance, extremism and totalitarianism. And it is an indispensable source of inspiration and renewal. Human diversity has many dimensions: gender, social, cultural, spiritual, philosophical, religious, linguistic, economic, ethnic, sexual, regional. These may be expressed by individuals or by social groups. We cherish this diversity. It should however never be used as a pretext for questioning universal rights. Where people share the same limited space, differences may easily be perceived as threats. Even in the smallest community, the strong tend to make use of their dominant role whereas the weak often find themselves pushed to conform. Safeguarding diversity therefore requires recognition, mutual understanding and respect – and, only too often, active protection. V. Non-Violence Non-violence forms a key part of the philosophical background of Green theories and conditions our approach to all problems. No lasting solution to any conflict between individuals, social groups or States can be imposed by force. A basic green principle is that the means used to achieve an objective must be compatible with the objective itself. So the political search for justice and peace cannot be achieved by violent means. Violence is not just physical. Human actions and global economic structures can deprive people of their human rights and exacerbate social injustice. Poverty is perhaps the most insidious form of violence. To eliminate poverty, we promote international bodies that aim at economic equity and put people's livelihoods and security first, as well as binding global rules for the protection of human rights. Insofar as armed conflicts are concerned, we are convinced that the use of army or police forces as an isolated strategy cannot be successful in the long run. Greens want to see less military intervention and the implementation of the concept of a civil foreign and security policy. This requires the development of powerful tools for conflict prevention and civil conflict management. Nevertheless Greens recognise that military means may be called upon by the international community as a last resort. Where there is a threat of mass violence against civilians, deployment of peace-keeping military forces may be justified as a deterrent. When preventative measures have failed, armed intervention may be necessary. Recourse to military means will be subject to the rule of international law and is only legitimate if the following conditions are met: — the existence of an explicit mandate of the UN Security Council; — the agreement to the primary objective of intervening in order to save and protect lives through preventing violence; — the existence of a political strategy defining how such military intervention should end and a peaceful and stable situation be established. VI. To sum it up, Sustainable Development Greens recognize that the values of environmental responsibility, freedom, justice, diversity and non-violence can be – and are to some extent – shared by other political families. What defines Greens is that we consider these values as interdependent and inseparable. As a whole, they determine all our actions directed towards the sustainable social, cultural, environmental and economic development of our societies on planet Earth. We apply them not only to our external policies but to our own political conduct as well as to the organisation of our own party. Europeans were the pioneers of the process of industrialization which is at the heart of some of our worst global problems. As citizens of one of the wealthiest continents on Earth, we Europeans carry a major responsibility for the reversal of the destructive trends it has generated and for initiating an alternative and sustainable development model. The scope of the issues at stake is such that it is beyond the powers of any single state to achieve this aim. Therefore we need cooperation in which all of Europe — from Dublin to Tbilisi, from Helsinki to Lisbon, from Ankara to Reykjavik — will be able to participate. The European Union is well placed to facilitate this cooperation, providing that: a) it remains open for further enlargements; b) it restructures itself into a truly democratic institution, c) it reorients its priorities towards an environmentally and socially sustainable model of development and d) it assumes its global responsibilities, under the United Nations, and in cooperation with other valuable institutions such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe, for a peaceful and sustainable world.

Acting globally 45 Preamble We, as citizens of the planet and members of the Global Greens, United in our awareness that we depend on the Earth's vitality, diversity and beauty, and that it is our responsibility to pass them on, undiminished or even improved, to the next generation Recognising that the dominant patterns of human production and consumption, based on the dogma of economic growth at any cost and the excessive and wasteful use of natural resources without considering Earth's carrying capacity, are causing extreme deterioration in the environment and a massive extinction of species Acknowledging that injustice, racism, poverty, ignorance, corruption, crime and violence, armed conflict and the search for maximum short term profit are causing widespread human suffering Accepting that developed countries through their pursuit of economic and political goals have contributed to the degradation of the environment and of human dignity Understanding that many of the world's peoples and nations have been impoverished by the long centuries of colonisation and exploitation, creating an ecological debt owed by the rich nations to those that have been impoverished Committed to closing the gap between rich and poor and building a citizenship based on equal rights for all individuals in all spheres of social, economic, political and cultural life Recognising that without equality between men and women, no real democracy can be achieved Concerned for the dignity of humanity and the value of cultural heritage Recognising the rights of indigenous people and their contribution to the common heritage, as well as the right of all minorities and oppressed peoples to their culture, religion, economic and cultural life Convinced that cooperation rather than competition is a pre-requisite for ensuring the guarantee of such human rights as nutritious food, comfortable shelter, health, education, fair labour, free speech, clean air, potable water and an unspoilt natural environment Recognising that the environment ignores borders between countries and Building on the Declaration of the Global Gathering of Greens at Rio in 1992 Assert the need for fundamental changes in people's attitudes, values, and ways of producing and living Declare that the new millennium provides a defining point to begin that transformation Resolve to promote a comprehensive concept of sustainability which — protects and restores the integrity of the Earth's ecosystems, with special concern for biodiversity and the natural processes that sustain life — acknowledges the interrelatedness of all ecological, social and economic processes — balances individual interests with the common good — harmonises freedom with responsibility — welcomes diversity within unity — reconciles short term objectives with long term goals — ensures that future generations have the same right as the present generation to natural and cultural benefits Affirm our responsibility to one another, to the greater community of life, and to future generations Commit ourselves as Green parties and political movements from around the world to implement these interrelated principles and to create a global partnership in support of their fulfillment Principles The policies of the Global Greens are founded upon the principles of Ecological Wisdom We acknowledge that human beings are part of the natural world and we respect the specific values of all forms of life, including non-human species. We acknowledge the wisdom of the indigenous peoples of the world, as custodians of the land and its resources. We acknowledge that human society depends on the ecological resources of the planet, and must ensure the integrity of ecosystems and preserve biodiversity and the resilience of life supporting systems. This requires — that we learn to live within the ecological and resource limits of the planet — that we protect animal and plant life, and life itself that is sustained by the natural elements: earth, water, air and sun — where knowledge is limited, that we take the path of caution, in order to secure the continued abundance of the resources of the planet for present and future generations. Social Justice We assert that the key to social justice is the equitable distribution of social and natural resources, both locally and globally, to meet basic human needs unconditionally, and to ensure that all citizens have full opportunities for personal and social development. We declare that there is no social justice without environmental justice, and no environmental justice without social justice. This requires — a just organization of the world and a stable world economy which will close the widening gap between rich and poor, both within and between countries; balance the flow of resources from South to North; and lift the burden of debt on poor countries which prevents their development. — the eradication of poverty, as an ethical, social, economic, and ecological imperative — the elimination of illiteracy — a new vision of citizenship built on equal rights for all individuals regardless of gender, race, age, religion, class, ethnic or national origin, sexual orientation, disability, wealth or health Participatory Democracy We strive for a democracy in which all citizens have the right to express their views, and are able to directly participate in the environmental, economic, social and political decisions which affect their lives; so that power and responsibility are concentrated in local and regional communities, and devolved only where essential to higher tiers of governance. This requires — individual empowerment through access to all the relevant information required for any decision, and access to education to enable all to participate — breaking down inequalities of wealth and power that inhibit participation — building grassroots institutions that enable decisions to be made directly at the appropriate level by those affected, based on systems which encourage civic vitality, voluntary action and community responsibility — strong support for giving young people a voice through educating, encouraging and assisting youth involvement in every aspect of political life including their participation in all decision making bodies. — that all elected representatives are committed to the principles of transparency, truthfulness, and accountability in governance. — that all electoral systems are transparent and democratic, and that this is enforced by law — that in all electoral systems, each adult has an equal vote — that all electoral systems are based on proportional representation, and all elections are publicly funded with strict limits on, and full transparency of, corporate and private donations. — that all citizens have the right to be a member of the political party of their choice within a multi-party system Nonviolence We declare our commitment to nonviolence and strive for a culture of peace and cooperation between states, inside societies and between individuals, as the basis of global security. We believe that security should not rest mainly on military strength but on cooperation, sound economic and social development, environmental safety, and respect for human rights. This requires — a comprehensive concept of global security, which gives priority to social, economic, ecological, psychological and cultural aspects of conflict, instead of a concept based primarily on military balances of power — a global security system capable of the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts — removing the causes of war by understanding and respecting other cultures, eradicating racism, promoting freedom and democracy, and ending global poverty — pursuing general and complete disarmament including international agreements to ensure a complete and definitive ban of nuclear, biological and chemical arms, anti-personnel mines and depleted uranium weapons — strengthening the United Nations (UN) as the global organisation of conflict management and peacekeeping — pursuing a rigorous code of conduct on arms exports to countries where human rights are being violated. Sustainability We recognise the limited scope for the material expansion of human society within the biosphere, and the need to maintain biodiversity through sustainable use of renewable resources and responsible use of non-renewable resources. We believe that to achieve sustainability, and in order to provide for the needs of present and future generations within the finite resources of the earth, continuing growth in global consumption, population and material inequity must be halted and reversed. We recognise that sustainability will not be possible as long as poverty persists. This requires — ensuring that the rich limit their consumption to allow the poor their fair share of the earth's resources — redefining the concept of wealth, to focus on quality of life rather than capacity for over-consumption — creating a world economy which aims to satisfy the needs of all, not the greed of a few; and enables those presently living to meet their own needs, without jeopardising the ability of future generations to meet theirs — eliminating the causes of population growth by ensuring economic security, and providing access to basic education and health, for all; giving both men and women greater control over their fertility — redefining the roles and responsibilities of trans-national corporations in order to support the principles of sustainable development — implementing mechanisms to tax, as well as regulating, speculative financial flows — ensuring that market prices of goods and services fully incorporate the environmental costs of their production and consumption — achieving greater resource and energy efficiency and development and use of environmentally sustainable technologies — encouraging local self-reliance to the greatest practical extent to create worthwhile, satisfying communities — recognising the key role of youth culture and encouraging an ethic of sustainability within that culture. Respect for Diversity We honour cultural, linguistic, ethnic, sexual, religious and spiritual diversity within the context of individual responsibility toward all beings. We defend the right of all persons, without discrimination, to an environment supportive of their dignity, bodily health, and spiritual well-being We promote the building of respectful, positive and responsible relationships across lines of division in the spirit of a multi-cultural society. This requires — recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples to the basic means of their survival, both economic and cultural, including rights to land and to self determination; and acknowledgment of their contribution to the common heritage of national and global culture — recognition of the rights of ethnic minorities to develop their culture, religion and language without discrimination, and to full legal, social and cultural participation in the democratic process — recognition of and respect for sexual minorities — equality between women and men in all spheres of social, economic, political and cultural life — significant involvement of youth culture as a valuable contribution to our Green vision, and recognition that young people have distinct needs and modes of expression. Political Action 1. Democracy 1.0. The majority of the world's people live in countries with undemocratic regimes where corruption is rampant and human rights abuses and press censorship are commonplace. Developed democracies suffer less apparent forms of corruption through media concentration, corporate political funding, systematic exclusion of racial, ethnic, national and religious communities, and electoral systems that discriminate against alternative ideas and new and small parties. The Greens - 1.1. Have as a priority the encouragement and support of grassroots movements and other organisations of civil society working for democratic, transparent and accountable government, at all levels. 1.2. Actively support giving young people a voice through educating, encouraging and assisting youth participation in every aspect of political action. 1.3. Will strive for the democratisation of gender relations by promoting appropriate mediations to enable women and men equally to take part in the economic, political, social sphere. 1.4. Support the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business and urge non-parties to sign and ratify without further delay 1.5. Uphold the right of citizens to have access to official information and to free and independent media. 1.6. Will work for universal access to electronic communications and information technology, as minimum, through radio, community-based internet and email. We will also work to make access to these technologies as cheap as possible. 1.7. Uphold a just secular legal system that ensures the right of defence and practices proportionality between crime and punishment. 1.8. Support the public funding of elections, and measures to ensure all donations are fully transparent and accountable and are free from undue influence, whether perceived or otherwise. 1.9. Will challenge corporate domination of government, especially where citizens are deprived of their right to political participation. 1.10. Support the separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial systems, and the separation of state and religion. 1.11. Support the development and strengthening of local government. 1.12. Support the restructuring of state institutions to democratise and make them more transparent and efficient in serving the goal of citizens' power and sustainable development. 1.13. Support global governance based on the democratic principle of one person — one vote — one value, rather than by unelected corporate interests. 2. Equity 2.0. The differences in living standards and opportunities in the world today are intolerable. Third world debt is at an all time high of US$3,7 trillion while Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries give just 0,31 % of GNP in aid. The richest 20 % of the world's population has 83 % of global income while the poorest 20 %, including nearly 50 % of the world's young people, share barely 1 % and 2,6 billion people live on less than US$2 a day. 60 % of the world's poor are women. 130 million children never attend school while 800 million adults can neither read nor write, two-thirds of them women Population growth has slowed but world population is projected to grow from 6,1 billion in 2000 to 8,9 billion in 2050, an increase of 47 %. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain severe problems. The Greens - 2.1. Will work to increase government aid to developing countries, and support aid funding being directed to the poorest of the poor, with the priorities being determined through working with local communities. 2.2. Will work to improve the rights, status, education and political participation of women. 2.3. Commit ourselves to the goal of making high quality primary education universal by 2015 financed through increased aid and debt relief. 2.4. Will work towards cancellation of developing country debt especially in the poorest countries, and support the use of incentives to ensure that savings from debt relief are channelled into poverty reduction and environment conservation, and that transparent and accountable processes are in place with participation from affected communities. 2.5. See concerted action to combat the great pandemics including HIV-Aids, TB and malaria as a priority, especially in Africa, where a twofold effort is needed to allow general access to low cost and efficient therapies, and to restore economic progress, especially through education. 2.6. Recognise the right to compensation of those people that lose access to their natural resources through displacement by environmental destruction or human intervention such as colonisation and migration. 2.7. Will review the relationship between exclusive ownership of property and exclusive use of its resources, with a view to curbing environmental abuse and extending access for basic livelihood to all, especially indigenous communities. 2.8. Will work to ensure that all men, women and children can achieve economic security, without recourse to personally damaging activities such as pornography, prostitution or the sale of organs. 2.9. Will commit to work for more equal allocation of welfare and for creation of equal opportunities inside all our societies, recognising that there is a growing number of poor and marginalised people in developed countries also. 2.10. Understand that the current form of financialised neo-liberal capitalism aids the rich and is crisis prone. It contributes to growing inequality and dispossession of poor people 2.11. Will defend and promote the human, social and environmental rights of people of colour. 3. Climate change and energy 3.0. The climate crisis is both greatest challenge facing the global community and the greatest opportunity for humanity to rethink how we live, in a way that is socially just and within the Earth's ecological limits. The Greens are committed to limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1,5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Global emissions will need to peak well before 2020 to have a chance to stay within this temperature limit. The Greens - 3.1. Adopt the target of limiting CO 2 levels in the atmosphere to 450 ppm in the shortest period possible. 3.2. Will work to support a rapid transition to zero carbon economies around the world. 3.3. Will work to establish an international emissions reporting framework for trans-national corporations, linked to global carbon taxes and global environmental loads. 3.4. Will work hard to ensure that developing countries have access to the most efficient, sustainable and appropriate technology, with a strong focus on renewable energy, and that they agree to Climate Change Conventions to ensure that actions are comprehensive and worldwide. The equity principle must be at the core of climate change negotiations and measures. 3.5. Oppose any expansion of nuclear power and will work to phase it out rapidly. 3.6. Will support a call for a moratorium on new fossil fuel exploration and development 3.7. Will work to stop deforestation and degradation of natural forests by 2020, noting that they are the most carbon rich ecosystems on the planet, vital to indigenous people, rich in plants and animals, and irreplaceable in any human time scale. 3.8. Promote tree planting of diverse species but not monocultures, as a short-term measure for carbon sequestration, with other benefits for the environment. 3.9. Promote the levying of taxes on non-renewable energy and support the use of funds raised to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. 3.10. Support research into the use of sustainable energy sources and the technical development of ecological power production 3.11. Promote transfer of energy efficient technologies and green power infrastructure between and within countries and economies on a no-costs or minimal costs basis. This is one of the economic costs of the emissions to date by western countries. 4. Biodiversity 4.0. Healthy ecosystems are essential to human life, yet we seem to have forgotten the relationship between nature and society. Extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times higher than in pre-human times. Only 20 % of the Earth's original forests remain relatively undisturbed. 80 % of fish stocks are already depleted or in danger of being overfished. Invasions by non-native plants, animals and diseases are growing rapidly. Habitat destruction and species extinction are driven by industrial and agricultural development that also exacerbates climate change, global inequity and the destruction of indigenous cultures and livelihoods. Agricultural monoculture, promoted by agribusiness and accelerated by genetic modification and patenting of nature, threatens the diversity of crop and domestic animal species, radically increasing vulnerability to disease. The Greens - 4.1. Will vigorously oppose environmentally destructive agricultural and industrial development and give primary effort to protecting native plants and animals in their natural habitat, and wherever possible in large tracts. 4.2. Will work to remove subsidies for environmentally destructive activities, including logging, fossil fuel exploitation, dam construction, mining, genetic engineering and agricultural monoculture. 4.3. Will promote ecological purchasing policies, for products such as wood, based only on the most rigorous definition of sustainability backed by credible labelling. 4.4. Support the concept of ‘debt for nature’ swaps, subject to the agreement of affected indigenous and local communities. 4.5. Will promote the repair of degraded natural environments, and the cleanup of toxic sites of former and existing military and industrial zones around the world. 4.6. Note that reducing the transport of goods around the world, in line with a preference for local production where possible, will have the added benefit of reducing ‘bio-invasions’, as well as reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 4.7. Commit to promote a global ecology curriculum for all levels of education. 4.8. Will work towards establishing an international court of justice specifically for environmental destruction and the loss of biodiversity where cases can be heard against corporations, national, states and individuals. 4.9. Will refuse to accept the patenting and merchandising of life. 5. Governing economic globalisation by sustainability principles 5.0. Fifty-three of the 100 biggest economies in the world today are corporations. With the collusion of governments, they have created a legal system that puts unfettered economic activity above the public good, protects corporate welfare but attacks social welfare, and makes national economies subservient to a global financial casino that turns over $US3 trillion per day in speculative transactions. The Global Financial Crisis has increased volatility and insecurity in all economies, with the most significant impact on poorer individuals, groups and countries. The IMF and the World Bank have contributed to this crisis rather than been part of the solution; the prerequisites on which they are based are not fit to create a global, sustainable and just economic system. The Greens - 5.1. Affirm that essentials of life, such as water, must remain publicly owned and controlled; and that culture, basic access to food, social and public health, education, and a free media are not ‘commodities’ to be subjected to international market agreements. 5.2. Support the creation of a World Environment Organisation by combining the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) into a single institution with funding and power to impose sanctions to promote global sustainable development. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) should be subject to the decisions of this body. 5.3. Support serious reform of the World Bank and IMF so that their membership and decision-making are democratic, and their operations subservient to sustainability principles and to all international conventions on human and labour rights, and environmental protection. 5.4. Support serious reform of the WTO to make sustainability its central goal, supported by transparent and democratic processes and the participation of representatives from affected communities. In addition there must be separation of powers to remove the disputes settlement mechanism from the exclusive competence of the WTO. A sustainability impact assessment of earlier Negotiation Rounds is required before any new steps are taken. 5.5. Will work to prevent the implementation of new regional or hemispheric trade and investment agreements under the WTO rules but support countries' integration processes that assure people's welfare and environmental sustainability. 5.6. Will create a world environment where financial and economic institutions and organisations will nurture and protect environmentally sustainable projects that will sustain communities at all levels (local, regional, national and international). 5.7. Demand that international agreements on the environment, labour conditions and health should take precedence over any international rules on trade. 5.8. Will work to implement a Tobin-Henderson or Financial Transactions Tax and other instruments to curb speculative international currency transactions and help encourage investment in the real economy, and to create funds to promote equity in global development. 5.9. Will work to require corporations to abide by the environmental, labour and social laws of their own country and of the country in which they are operating, whichever are the more stringent 5.10. Will work to ensure that all global organizations, especially those with significant capacity to define the rules of international trade, firmly adhere to principles of sustainable development and pursue a training program of cultural change to fully realise this goal. 5.11. Want corporate welfare made transparent and subject to the same level of accountability as social welfare, with subsidies to environmentally and socially destructive activities phased out altogether. 5.12. Endorse the development of civic entrepreneurship to promote a community based economy as a way of combating social exclusion caused by economic globalisation. 6. Human rights 6.0. Denial of human rights and freedoms goes hand in hand with poverty and political powerlessness. Millions suffer discrimination, intimidation, arbitrary detention, violence and death. Three-quarters of the world's governments have used torture in the last three years. The Greens - 6.1. Endorse the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, and other international instruments for the protection of rights and freedoms. We believe that these rights are universal and indivisible and that national governments are responsible for upholding them. 6.2. Condemn all dictatorships and regimes which deny human rights, regardless of their political claims 6.3. Will work with local communities to promote awareness of human rights, and to ensure that the UN Commission for Human Rights and other treaty bodies are adequately resourced. 6.4. Call for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be amended to include rights to a healthy natural environment and intergenerational rights to natural and cultural resources. 6.5. Uphold the right of women to make their own decisions, including the control of their fertility by the means they deem appropriate, free from discrimination or coercion; support the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW); urge non-signatories to sign and ratify without further delay; and urge existing signatories to remove all reservations. 6.6. Support the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination, land rights, and access to traditional hunting and fishing rights for their own subsistence, using humane and ecologically sustainable techniques; and support moves for indigenous people to set up and work through their own international bodies. 6.7. Support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as the minimum standard of protection accepted by indigenous peoples, and support moves for indigenous people to set up and work through their own international bodies. 6.8. Demand that torturers are held accountable, and will campaign for them to be brought to justice, in their own countries or elsewhere, before an international panel of judges serving under the auspices of the International Criminal Court. 6.9. Oppose any violation of the physical integrity of the individual by torture, punishment or any other practices including traditional and religious mutilation. 6.10. Demand that the death penalty be abolished worldwide. 6.11. Call for governments to ensure that all asylum-seekers, whether they are victims of state violence or independent armed groups, are correctly treated in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Rights to Asylum; have access to fair processes; are not arbitrarily detained; and are not returned to a country where they might suffer violations of their fundamental human rights, or face the risk of death, torture, or other inhuman treatment. 6.12. Call for the prohibition of collective expulsion. 6.13. Uphold the right of all workers to safe, fairly remunerated employment, with the freedom to unionise. 6.14. Support the right of children to grow up free from the need to work, and the establishment of a lower age limit for working children/adolescents. 6.15. Demand decriminalisation of homosexuality, and support the right of gay and lesbian people to their lifestyle, and the equal rights of homosexual relationships. 6.16. Will work to improve the opportunities of disabled people to live and work equally in society, including true political participation. 6.17. Support the right of linguistic minorities to use their own language. 7. Food and water 7.0. Hundreds of millions of people remain undernourished, not because there is insufficient food but because of unequal access to land, water, credit and markets. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are not the solution, because the immediate problem is not production but distribution. Moreover, GMOs pose unacceptable risks to the environment, independent smaller farmers, and consumers, as well as to the biodiversity that is our best insurance against agricultural disaster. Water shortages loom, both in above-ground systems and subterranean aquifers. Deforestation of catchments takes a devastating toll in landslides and floods, while desertification and degradation rapidly are expanding. One bright spot is the rapid growth of organic agriculture. The Greens - 7.1. Consider that access to clean water for basic needs is a fundamental right and oppose the privatisation of water resources and infrastructure. 7.2. Will work to eliminate water subsidies, other than social subsidies, and to make water use more efficient. 7.3. Will work to ensure that fresh water and underground water resources are conserved in quality and quantity and appropriately priced to ensure these resources are adequately protected from depletion 7.4. Consider that the stability of catchments and the health of river systems is paramount, and will work with the people directly affected to stop the degradation of rivers, including new large dams and irrigation projects, and deforestation of catchments. 7.5. Will work with local communities in arid and semi-arid regions, where climate is dominated by uncertainty, to reduce land degradation. 7.6. Express their concern for countries that have been hard hit by desertification and deforestation, and ask the countries that have not yet done so to ratify the UN Convention of Desertification, and make the necessary resources available to enact this Convention. 7.7. Will support and promote organic agriculture. 7.8. Call for a worldwide ban on the commercial growing of genetically modified crops. 7.9. Will work to ensure that food is safe, with stringent regulations on production, storage and sale. 7.10. Will work to ensure that scientific research is conducted ethically and applied in accordance with the precautionary principle. 7.11. Call for a phase out of all persistent and bio-accumulative man- made chemicals and to work to eliminate all releases to the environment of hazardous chemicals. 7.12. Will work to ensure that animal growth hormones are banned, and stringent regulations governing the use of antibiotics on animals are enforced. 7.13. Will work to ensure the humane treatment of all animals during breeding, transport and slaughter and will ensure animal welfare. 7.14. Will work towards ensuring the effect of erosion, floods and other environmental hazards are ameliorated and that appropriate adaptation measures are implemented. 8. Sustainable planning 8.0. Consumption in industrialised countries is excessive by any measure, and largely responsible for environmental decline. Newly industrialising countries are also increasing their consumption, which will add significantly to the ecological pressure. Changing to a green economy — which mimics ecological processes, eliminates waste by re-using and recycling materials, and emphasises activities that enhance the quality of life and relationships rather than the consumption of goods — brings a promise of new jobs, industries with less pollution, better work environments and a higher quality of life. The Greens - 8.1. Promote measures of well-being rather than GDP to measure progress, and recognise the ecological limits to material growth and consumption. 8.2. Consider that citizens of countries affected by a development project have the right to participate in decisions about it, regardless of national boundaries. 8.3. Will work to ensure that those who profit from exploiting any common and/or natural resources should pay the full market rent for the use of these resources, and for any damage they do to any other common resources. 8.4. Recognise that the impact of continuing urban growth (sprawl) onto agricultural land and the natural environment must be limited and ultimately stopped 8.5. Recognise that the process of urbanisation due to rural poverty must be slowed and reversed through appropriate rural development programs which protect the character and ecology of the rural landscape. 8.6. Support local planning for ecologically sustainable business, housing, transport, waste management, parks, city forests, public spaces; and will establish links between Greens at local and regional level around the planet to exchange information and support. 8.7. Will work to reduce vehicle based urban pollution by opposing ever-expanding freeways; encouraging the use of energy efficient vehicles; integrating land use planning with public transport, bicycling and walking; prioritising mass transit planning and funding over private auto infrastructure; and eliminating tax policies that favour auto-centric development. 8.8. Will work to create socially responsible economic strategies, using taxes and public finance to maximise incentives for fair distribution of wealth, and eco-taxes to provide incentives to avoid waste and pollution. 8.9. Demand that corporations and communities reduce, reuse and recycle waste, aiming for a zero waste economy which replicates a natural ecosystem. 8.10. Will support all policies that allow countries to increase job creation through economic activities that add value, or through recycling of resources, the production of durable goods, organic agriculture, renewable energy and environmental protection. 8.11. Promote socially responsible investment and ecological marketing so that consumers can make positive choices based on reliable information. 8.12. Recognise the value of traditional and local knowledge and beliefs, and support its incorporation into planning and projects. 9. Peace and security 9.0. We understand peace as being more than the absence of war. To strive for peace has always been at the core of the Green agenda. The causes of conflict are changing. The impacts of climate change, competition for water, food and resources will become increasingly significant. The distinctions between war, organised crime and deliberate large-scale abuses of human rights are becoming progressively blurred. Since 2001 the war on ‘terror’ has also led to the erosion of human rights in the name of security. The arms trade is growing and globalising, nourished by a unique exemption from WTO rules against subsidies. As a global network, we have a vital role to play in strengthening the links between community organisations working for human rights and peace, and supporting and shaping the emerging concepts and institutions of global governance. The Greens - 9.1. Support strengthening the role of the UN as a global organisation of conflict management and peacekeeping, while, noting that, where prevention fails and in situations of structural and massive violations of human rights and/or genocide, the use of force may be justified if it is the only means of preventing further human rights violations and suffering, provided that it is used under a mandate from the UN. Nonetheless, individual countries have the right not to support or to cooperate with the action. 9.2. Will campaign for greater power for countries of the South in the UN, by working to abolish the veto power in the Security Council, to remove the category of permanent membership of it, and to increase the number of states with membership. 9.3. Support the International Criminal Court. In war crimes, sexualised violence such as mass rape should be regarded as a war crime, as should environmental crimes in times of conflict. 9.4. Seek to curtail the power of the military-industrial-financial complex in order to radically reduce the trade in armaments, ensure transparency of manufacturing and remove hidden subsidies that benefit the military industries. 9.5. Will work to regulate and reduce, with the long term aim of eliminating, the international arms trade (including banning nuclear, biological and chemical arms, depleted uranium weapons and anti-personnel mines) and bring it within the ambit of the UN. 9.6. Will help strengthen existing peace programmes and forge new programmes that address all aspects of building a culture of peace. Programmes will include analysis of the roots of violence, including inter-familial violence, and the issue of mutual respect between genders; and support training in non-violent conflict resolution at all levels. 9.7. Will seek to amend the international rules of military engagement to ensure that natural resources are adequately protected in conflicts. 9.8. Will fight against any National Missile Defence Project, and work towards the demilitarisation and de-nuclearisation of space. 10. Acting globally 10.0. The Global Greens are independent organisations from diverse cultures and backgrounds who share a common purpose and recognise that, to achieve it, we must act globally as well as locally. The Greens - 10.1. Will work cooperatively to implement the Global Greens Charter by taking action together on issues of global consequence whenever needed. 10.2. Will support the development of Green parties, political movements and youth networks around the world. 10.3. Will assist, at their request, other Green parties and movements including by — providing observers at elections to help ensure that they are free and fair; — encouraging voters to enrol and vote Green in their home countries. 10.4. Will adopt and put into practice in our own organisations the democratic principles we seek in broader society. 10.5. Will act as a model of participatory democracy in our own internal organisation at all levels. 10.6. Will encourage cooperation between the global Green parties to ensure that member parties are consulted, educated and have equal capacity to influence global positions of the Greens. 10.7. Will encourage Green parties and green political movements to show leadership in establishing policies guaranteeing transparent and decentralised structures, so that political power and opportunity is extended to all members; and in developing new political models which better meet the challenges of sustainable development and grassroots democracy. 10.8. Will avoid sources of finance that conflict with our vision and values. 10.9. Will avoid cooperation with dictatorships, sects, or criminal organisations and with their dependent organisations, particularly in matters of democracy and human rights. 10.10. Will strengthen our links with like-minded community organisations, and with civil society organisations; we are one part, with them, of the growing consciousness that respect for the environment, for social and human rights, and for democracy, has to prevail on the economic organisation of the world. 10.11. Will support each other personally and politically with friendship, optimism and good humour, and not forget to enjoy ourselves in the process!",

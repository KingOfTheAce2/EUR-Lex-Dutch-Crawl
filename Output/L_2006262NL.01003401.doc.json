Article 8 Measures against the smuggling of migrants by sea 1.   A State Party that has reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel that is flying its flag or claiming its registry, that is without nationality or that, though flying a foreign flag or refusing to show a flag, is in reality of the nationality of the State Party concerned is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea may request the assistance of other States Parties in suppressing the use of the vessel for that purpose. The States Parties so requested shall render such assistance to the extent possible within their means. 2.   A State Party that has reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel exercising freedom of navigation in accordance with international law and flying the flag or displaying the marks of registry of another State Party is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea may so notify the flag State, request confirmation of registry and, if confirmed, request authorisation from the flag State to take appropriate measures with regard to that vessel. The flag State may authorise the requesting State, inter alia : (a) to board the vessel; (b) to search the vessel; and (c) if evidence is found that the vessel is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea, to take appropriate measures with respect to the vessel and persons and cargo on board, as authorised by the flag State. 3.   A State Party that has taken any measure in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article shall promptly inform the flag State concerned of the results of that measure. 4.   A State Party shall respond expeditiously to a request from another State Party to determine whether a vessel that is claiming its registry or flying its flag is entitled to do so and to a request for authorisation made in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article. 5.   A flag State may, consistent with article 7 of this Protocol, subject its authorisation to conditions to be agreed by it and the requesting State, including conditions relating to responsibility and the extent of effective measures to be taken. A State Party shall take no additional measures without the express authorisation of the flag State, except those necessary to relieve imminent danger to the lives of persons or those which derive from relevant bilateral or multilateral agreements. 6.   Each State Party shall designate an authority or, where necessary, authorities to receive and respond to requests for assistance, for confirmation of registry or of the right of a vessel to fly its flag and for authorisation to take appropriate measures. Such designation shall be notified through the Secretary-General to all other States Parties within one month of the designation. 7.   A State Party that has reasonable grounds to suspect that a vessel is engaged in the smuggling of migrants by sea and is without nationality or may be assimilated to a vessel without nationality may board and search the vessel. If evidence confirming the suspicion is found, that State Party shall take appropriate measures in accordance with relevant domestic and international law.

BIJLAGE II Verklaring betreffende de bevoegdheid van de Europese Gemeenschap ten aanzien van aangelegenheden die zijn geregeld bij het Protocol tegen de smokkel van migranten over land, over zee en door de lucht, ter aanvulling van het Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties tegen grensoverschrijdende georganiseerde misdaad Artikel 21, lid 3, van het protocol bepaalt dat in de akte van toetreding van een regionale organisatie voor economische integratie een verklaring moet worden opgenomen waarin de bij het protocol geregelde aangelegenheden worden opgesomd ten aanzien waarvan de bevoegdheid aan de organisatie is overgedragen door haar lidstaten die partij zijn bij het protocol. Het Protocol tegen de smokkel van migranten over land, over zee en door de lucht, is, voor wat betreft de aan de Europese Gemeenschap overgedragen bevoegdheden, van toepassing op de grondgebieden waarop het Verdrag tot oprichting van de Europese Gemeenschap van toepassing is, onder de in dat Verdrag, met name artikel 299 en de eraan gehechte protocollen, beschreven voorwaarden. Deze verklaring laat de positie van het Verenigd Koninkrijk en Ierland krachtens het Protocol tot opneming van het Schengenacquis in het kader van de Europese Unie alsmede krachtens het Protocol betreffende de positie van het Verenigd Koninkrijk en Ierland gehecht aan het Verdrag betreffende de Europese Unie en het Verdrag tot oprichting van de Europese Gemeenschap, onverlet. Deze verklaring laat voorts de positie van Denemarken krachtens het Protocol betreffende de positie van Denemarken gehecht aan het Verdrag betreffende de Europese Unie en het Verdrag tot oprichting van de Europese Gemeenschap, onverlet. Deze verklaring is niet van toepassing op de grondgebieden van de lidstaten waarop het EG-Verdrag overeenkomstig artikel 299 niet van toepassing is, en laat de besluiten of standpunten onverlet die mogelijk door de betrokken lidstaten in het kader van het protocol zijn vastgesteld namens of in het belang van de betrokken grondgebieden. In overeenstemming met de bovengenoemde bepaling geeft deze verklaring aan welke bevoegdheid de lidstaten krachtens de Verdragen hebben overgedragen aan de Gemeenschap in aangelegenheden die worden geregeld bij het protocol. De omvang en de uitoefening van de desbetreffende communautaire bevoegdheid zijn uiteraard voortdurend in ontwikkeling naarmate de Gemeenschap nadere voorschriften en regelingen vaststelt, en de Gemeenschap zal deze verklaring zo nodig dan ook aanvullen of wijzigen overeenkomstig artikel 21, lid 3, van het protocol. De Gemeenschap wijst erop dat zij bevoegd is met betrekking tot de overschrijding van de buitengrenzen van de lidstaten, de vaststelling van normen en procedures voor het uitvoeren van personencontroles aan die grenzen, alsmede voorschriften inzake visa voor voorgenomen verblijven van ten hoogste drie maanden. De Gemeenschap is tevens bevoegd voor het nemen van maatregelen inzake immigratiebeleid met betrekking tot de voorwaarden voor toegang en verblijf alsmede maatregelen ter bestrijding van illegale immigratie en illegaal verblijf, met inbegrip van de repatriëring van illegaal verblijvende personen. Voorts kan zij maatregelen nemen om ervoor te zorgen dat de bevoegde overheidsdiensten van de lidstaten zowel onderling als met de Commissie samenwerken op de hierboven genoemde gebieden. Op deze gebieden heeft de Gemeenschap voorschriften en regelingen vastgesteld, zodat het uitsluitend aan de Gemeenschap is om, met betrekking tot de voorschriften en regelingen die zij ter zake heeft vastgesteld, externe verbintenissen aan te gaan met derde landen of bevoegde internationale organisaties. Ook het beleid van de Gemeenschap op het gebied van ontwikkelingssamenwerking sluit aan bij het door de lidstaten gevoerde beleid en bevat bepalingen ter voorkoming en bestrijding van migrantensmokkel.",

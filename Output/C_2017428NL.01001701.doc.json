The association was registered under legal person number 866441216. The undersigned, representing the Association, and in accordance with the decision of the General Assembly held in Brussels (24 June 2017) and the Congress held in Berlin (16-18 December 2016), are presenting the amendment of the Statute as follows: Statute Statute of the Party of the European Left (Full text of the Statute, as it was adopted at the Founding Congress of the European Left in Rome, May 9, 2004, with the amendments approved by the 2nd Congress in Prague, November 2007, by the 3rd Congress in Paris, December 5, 2010, by the 4th Congress in Madrid, December 14, 2013, by the 5th Congress in Berlin, December 18, 2016, and by the General Assembly meeting in Brussels, June 24, 2017.) 1. General Provisions, Name, Seat and Term Article 1 Preamble The ‘Party of the European Left’, abbreviated here to ‘European Left’ (EL) is a flexible, decentralised association of independent and sovereign European left-wing parties and political organizations which works on the basis of consensus. We unite democratic parties of the alternative and progressive Left on the European continent that strive for the consistent transformation of today's social relationships into a peaceful and socially just society on the basis of the diversity of our situations, our histories and our common values. Therefore we refer to the values and traditions of the socialist, communist and labour movement, of feminism, the feminist movement and gender equality, of the environmental movement and sustainable development, of peace and international solidarity, of human rights, humanism and antifascism, of progressive and liberal thinking, both nationally and internationally. We work together in the tradition of the struggles against capitalist exploitation, ecological destruction, political oppression and criminal wars, against fascism and dictatorship, in resistance to patriarchal domination and discrimination against ‘others’. We defend this legacy of our movement which inspired and contributed to securing the social certainties of millions of people. We keep the memory of these struggles alive including the sacrifices and the sufferings in the course of these struggles. We do this in unreserved disputation with undemocratic, Stalinist practices and crimes, which were in absolute contradiction to socialist and communist ideals. The political and economic developments in the capitalist societies at the beginning of the 21st century create the necessity and the possibility for parties of the Left, for democratic movements and alternative social forces, when working out and realising social alternatives not only to take into account all aspects of globalisation and internationalisation. Europe as a new space for the integration of more and more countries in East and West, in North and South is both an opportunity and a challenge to regain the political initiative for Left forces. We want and have to most closely combine our work on this political level with the social activities of members and sympathizers of the party organisations within the communities, regions and nation states. We are doing it in sharp rejection of and developing an alternative to capitalism and to the financial hegemonic groups with its worldwide attempts of pushing through neo-liberal policies into the daily life of the peoples by the so-called political and economic elites. And we want and have to do so being not a force free of contradictions, having differing views on many issues. But we are united in resisting political incapacitation and taking part in common struggles for an alternative that has freedom, equality, justice and solidarity as its goals. With this international approach we declare: The Left is willing to take on responsibility in Europe and the world for the shaping of our societies, to work out political alternatives, to promote them among the public and to win the required majorities. Liberal internationalisation and globalisation are no phenomena of nature but the result of political developments and decisions. Therefore we stand consequently against the neo-liberal policy of dealing with these challenges, against war and militarization. Just now courage and confidence must be given to the people that the world is not a commodity, that a new world of peace, democracy, sustainability and solidarity is possible.

The EL supports fully gender equality in all areas of daily life. Feminism, gender-mainstreaming and gender-democracy are basic principles for the functioning and development of the EL. 3. Membership Article 5 Founding members of the EL are socialist, communist, red-green and other democratic left parties of the Member States and associated states of the European Union (EU) who are working together and establishing various forms of cooperation at all levels of political activity in Europe based on the agreements, basic principles and political aims laid down in its political programme (manifesto). Agreement on the European Left's Statutes is prerequisite for membership to the Party of the European Left. Membership to the EL is open to any left party and political organisation in Europe that agrees with the aims and principles of the political programme (manifesto) and accepts these statutes. Their membership is granted by decision of the members. Other parties and political organisations may apply for observer status or might be invited by the members to become observers to the EL. Number of member parties is unlimited, but the minimum number of full members is three. Should the number fall below this threshold, the Association is obliged to start procedures for its dissolution. Article 6 The European Left consists of: — Member parties and political organizations with full rights; — Observer parties or political organizations; — Individual members; — EL partners. Article 6bis List of actual members The member parties of European Left are: — Bulgarian Left, Bulgaria, — Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ), — Communist Party of Finland (SKP), Finland, — Communist Party of Spain (PCE), — Communist Refoundation Party (PRC), Italy, — Dei LENK (dL), Luxembourg, — Die LINKE, Germany, — Estonian United Left Party (EÜVP), Estonia, — Freedom and Solidarity Party (ODP), Turkey, — French Communist Party (PCF), France, — Initiative for Democratic Socialism (IDS), Slovenia, — Left Alliance, Finland, — Left Bloc (BE), Portugal, — Left Party (PG), France, — Partie Communiste Wallonie-Bruxelles (PCWB), Belgium, — Party of Communists of Republic of Moldova (PCRM), Moldova, — Party of Democratic Socialism (SDS), Czech Republic, — Party of Ecosocialism and Sustainable Development of Slovenia (TRS), — Red-Green Alliance (RGA), Denmark, — Romanian Socialist Party (RSP), Romania, — Swiss Party of Labour (PST/POP/PDA), Switzerland, — SYRIZA, Greece, — The Belarusian Party of the Left ‘Fair World’ (Fair World), Belarus, — United Alternative Left of Catalonia (EUiA), Spain, — United Left (IU), Spain, — Workers-Party 2006 (WP 2006), Hungary.

In EU Member States with no regional level it will be sufficient for a party or political organisation to have representatives on the municipal level, if a municipal parliament represents at least 20 percent of the country's population. Parties or political organisations, coming from EU Member States or non-EU-Member States, can become members of the European Left with full rights, irrespectively if they have parliamentarian representation on different levels. (2) Membership in the EL does not prohibit the membership in other associations, including outside the European Union if their acting is not contrary to the aims and principles of the EL. The structure of the EL allows political organisations which are politically close to the EL to take part in its activities in a flexible manner. If desirable for both sides, EL can establish a cooperation protocol for this purpose, and the respective organisations are entitled the designation ‘EL partner’. The main criterion here is the political consent with the basic positions of the EL; the decision-making process inside the EL on this issue follows the rules for decision about membership issues. (3) Applications for membership in the EL are discussed and decided by the Council of Chairpersons on a basis of proposals from the Executive board, and ratified by the General Assembly on suggestion of the Executive board on the basis of the application, the rules and political programme presented by the applicant. The decision by the Council of Chairpersons has to be based on consensus. (4) The temporary/provisional suspension from participation in activities, or the cancellation of membership in the EL in case a member party or political organisation seriously violates statutes and political aims are carried out through the same procedures as the admittance. (5) The applications for observer status is decided in the same way, except for the need of ratification. Observer parties or political organisations take part in the meetings, to which they are invited, as consultants. They can make proposals to the Executive board for examination and decision making. (6) Member parties or political organisations that want to leave the EL have to declare this officially; the same procedure applies to observers and individual members. Article 8 Individual members The EL introduces the opportunity of individual membership as a contribution to its future development. In countries where full-right member parties or political organizations exist each member party or political organization is free to decide to carry out this opportunity and to adopt — for its own country — the most convenient approach and practical methods. According to that approach women and men residents of an EU Member State can become individual members of the EL. In countries where full-right member parties or political organizations exist they can form friendship circles associated to these parties of the European Left. Citizens of other European countries associated to the EU can also apply for individual membership. They can join or create a national group of individual members applying for observer status in the EL. Article 9 Political foundation The political foundation on European level Transform!Europe is affiliated to the EL.
